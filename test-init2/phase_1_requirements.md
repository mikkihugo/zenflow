   - User profile management
   - Role-based access control (Admin, User)

2. **Task Management Module**
   - Create, read, update, delete tasks
   - Task assignment to users
   - Task status tracking (Todo, In Progress, Done)
   - Task priority levels (Low, Medium, High)
   - Task due dates and reminders

3. **Notification System**
   - Email notifications for task assignments
   - In-app notifications
   - Notification preferences management
   - Notification history

4. **API Layer**
   - RESTful API endpoints
   - GraphQL alternative endpoints
