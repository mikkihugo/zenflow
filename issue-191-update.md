# Update for Issue #191

@lontivero Great news! I've fixed the issue and published alpha.38 with the corrections.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Build Process** - Updated `prepublishOnly` in package.json:
   ```json
   // Before (alpha.27-37):
   "prepublishOnly": "echo 'Alpha release - skipping build/test/lint for now'"
   
   // Now (alpha.38+):
   "prepublishOnly": "npm run update-version"
   ```

2. **Automatic Version Updates** - Created `scripts/update-bin-version.js` that automatically syncs the VERSION in `bin/claude-flow` with package.json during the publish process.

## Verification

The fix is confirmed working in alpha.38:

```bash
# Now shows correct version:
$ npx -y claude-flow@2.0.0-alpha.38 --version
v2.0.0-alpha.38

# Also works with @alpha tag:
$ npx -y claude-flow@alpha --version
v2.0.0-alpha.38
```

## Long-term Fix

For future releases, the build process will be fully restored once we resolve the TypeScript compilation errors. The current solution ensures version consistency while we work on the complete fix.

Thanks again for the detailed bug report! The clear reproduction steps made it easy to identify and fix the root cause. üôè
