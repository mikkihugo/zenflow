## 🔧 Configuration Options

All components are highly configurable through the `CoordinationConfig` interface:

```typescript
interface CoordinationConfig {
  maxRetries: number;          // Task retry attempts
  retryDelay: number;         // Base retry delay
  deadlockDetection: boolean; // Enable deadlock detection
  resourceTimeout: number;    // Resource acquisition timeout

- Resource acquisition and release events
- Deadlock detection events
- Work stealing events
- Conflict detection and resolution events
- Circuit breaker state changes
- System health and error events

### Metrics Collection
Comprehensive metrics are automatically collected:
- Real-time performance indicators
- Historical trend analysis
- Resource utilization statistics
- Agent workload distribution
- Error rates and patterns

### Health Monitoring
Continuous health monitoring includes:
- Component health status
- Resource availability
- Agent responsiveness
- System performance metrics
- Error detection and alerting

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Coordination Setup
```typescript
import { CoordinationManager } from './coordination/index.ts';

const manager = new CoordinationManager(config, eventBus, logger);
await manager.initialize();

// Enable advanced features
manager.enableAdvancedScheduling();
```

### Advanced Scheduling
```typescript
// Register agents with capabilities
scheduler.registerAgent({
  id: 'analyst-1',
  capabilities: ['data-analysis', 'reporting'],
  priority: 10,
  maxConcurrentTasks: 5
});

// Tasks automatically assigned to best agents
await manager.assignTask(analysisTask);
```

### Resource Management
```typescript
// Acquire with priority and timeout
await manager.acquireResource('database-lock', agentId);
try {
  // Critical section
  await performDatabaseOperation();
} finally {
  await manager.releaseResource('database-lock', agentId);
}
```

### Conflict Resolution
```typescript
// Conflicts automatically detected and resolved
await manager.reportConflict('resource', 'shared-file', ['agent1', 'agent2']);
```
