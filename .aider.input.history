+   - Fix any dependency conflicts or vulnerabilities
+   - Ensure proper peer dependency management
+   - Optimize import/export patterns
+   - Clean up unused dependencies
+   - Standardize version management across packages
+
+3. OWNERSHIP & RESPONSIBILITY PATTERNS:
+   - Establish clear package ownership boundaries
+   - Implement proper service ownership patterns
+   - Define clear API contracts between packages
+   - Establish responsibility delegation patterns
+   - Implement proper error ownership and handling
+   - Create clear module responsibility definitions
+
+4. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
+   - Optimize development server startup times
+   - Improve hot reload and watch mode performance
+   - Enhance debugging capabilities
+   - Optimize test execution performance
+   - Improve linting and type checking workflows
+   - Standardize development scripts across packages
+
+5. PRODUCTION READINESS:
+   - Ensure robust error handling and logging
+   - Implement proper health checks and monitoring
+   - Optimize runtime performance
+   - Ensure proper resource management
+   - Implement graceful shutdown patterns
+   - Add comprehensive observability
+
+6. CODE ORGANIZATION & ARCHITECTURE:
+   - Optimize module organization and structure
+   - Improve code reusability and maintainability
+   - Enhance separation of concerns
+   - Optimize facade patterns and delegation
+   - Improve service registration and discovery
+   - Standardize architectural patterns
+
+TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
+======================
+- Maintain compatibility with existing strategic facade architecture
+- Preserve the 6-layer strategic facade system
+- Ensure all packages follow consistent patterns
+- Optimize for both development and production environments
+- Maintain type safety and strict TypeScript compliance
+- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
+- Follow enterprise-grade best practices
+
+DELIVERABLES:
+=============
+- Optimized build configuration files
+- Enhanced package.json scripts across all packages
+- Improved development workflow scripts
+- Optimized TypeScript configurations
+- Enhanced error handling and logging
+- Clear ownership documentation in code
+- Improved service registration patterns
+- Production-ready monitoring and health checks
+- Optimized import/export structures
+- Enhanced development tooling
+
+Please analyze the entire codebase systematically and implement comprehensive improvements that make this a world-class, enterprise-ready TypeScript monorepo with optimal build performance and clear ownership patterns.
