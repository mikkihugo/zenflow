# Release Notes: Claude Flow v2.0.0-alpha.50

**Release Date:** July 14, 2025

## 🌟 Highlights

Claude Flow alpha.50 introduces **Hive Mind Resume** - a game-changing feature that brings enterprise-grade persistence to swarm operations. Never lose progress again with automatic session tracking, state persistence, and seamless resume capabilities.

## ✨ What's New

### Hive Mind Resume System

The centerpiece of this release is the complete session management system for Hive Mind operations:

- **Automatic Session Creation**: Every swarm spawn now creates a trackable session
- **Progress Persistence**: State is automatically saved every 30 seconds
- **Graceful Interruption**: Press Ctrl+C without losing any work
- **Full Context Resume**: Continue exactly where you left off with complete state restoration
- **Claude Code Integration**: Resume sessions directly into Claude Code with full context

### Key Commands

```bash
# View all your sessions
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind sessions

# Resume a specific session
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-1234567890-abc

# Resume with Claude Code launch
npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-1234567890-abc --claude
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Install the latest alpha:**
   ```bash

2. **Start a new swarm (automatically creates a session):**

3. **Work on your task, then interrupt anytime:**
   - Press Ctrl+C to pause
   - Your progress is automatically saved

4. **Resume later:**
   ```bash
   npx claude-flow@alpha hive-mind resume session-xxxxx-xxxxx
