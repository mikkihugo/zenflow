# Neural Link System for Human-Hive Integration

## Overview
This project implements a neural link system designed for direct human-brain to hive-mind integration, enabling collective intelligence and shared consciousness capabilities.

## Architecture
- **Neural Interface Layer**: Captures and processes brain signals
- **Signal Processing Pipeline**: Real-time neural decoding
- **Communication Protocol**: Bidirectional brain-to-hive data transfer
- **Integration Layer**: Hive mind collective intelligence interface

## Safety & Ethics
All implementations follow strict biocompatibility and ethical guidelines for human neural interfaces.

## Status
ðŸ”„ Active Development - Research Phase
