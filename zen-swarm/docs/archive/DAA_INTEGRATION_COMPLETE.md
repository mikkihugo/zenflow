cd ruv-swarm
./build-wasm-optimized.sh

# Run tests
cd npm
npm test

# Use in Claude Code
npx ruv-swarm mcp start
```

## 🎨 Usage Example

```javascript
import { daaService, RuvSwarm } from '@ruv/swarm';

// Initialize DAA service
await daaService.initialize();

// Create swarm with DAA agents
const swarm = await RuvSwarm.createSwarm({
  topology: 'hierarchical',
  enableDAA: true
});

// Spawn DAA agents
const agents = await daaService.batchCreateAgents([
  { id: 'analyzer', capabilities: ['neural_processing', 'learning'] },
  { id: 'optimizer', capabilities: ['performance_optimization'] },
  { id: 'coordinator', capabilities: ['workflow_management'] }
]);

// Execute autonomous workflow
const workflow = await daaService.createWorkflow('ai-pipeline', [
  { id: 'analyze', type: 'analysis' },
  { id: 'optimize', type: 'optimization' },
  { id: 'deploy', type: 'deployment' }
]);

await daaService.executeWorkflow(workflow.id);
```
