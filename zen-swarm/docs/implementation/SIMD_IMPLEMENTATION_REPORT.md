## 🚀 Usage Examples

### JavaScript Integration
```javascript
import init, { 
    SimdVectorOps, 
    SimdMatrixOps,
    get_features,
    validate_simd_implementation 
} from './pkg/ruv_swarm_wasm.js';

await init();

// Check SIMD support
const features = JSON.parse(get_features());
console.log('SIMD supported:', features.simd_support);

// Use SIMD operations
const ops = new SimdVectorOps();
const result = ops.dot_product([1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8]);
console.log('Dot product:', result); // 70
```

### Neural Network with SIMD
```javascript
const network = new WasmNeuralNetwork([784, 256, 128, 10], ActivationFunction.ReLU);
network.randomize_weights(-1.0, 1.0);

// SIMD-accelerated inference
const input = new Array(784).fill(0).map(() => Math.random());
const output = network.run(input); // ~3x faster with SIMD
```
