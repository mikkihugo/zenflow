  - Primary: Convergent thinking
  - Secondary: Lateral thinking
  - Optimized for syntax analysis and code generation

- **Analyst**: 96-192-96-48 neurons, Tanh activation
  - Primary: Critical thinking
  - Secondary: Abstract thinking
  - Optimized for statistical modeling and trend detection

- **Optimizer**: 80-160-80-40 neurons, Sigmoid activation

  - Optimized for performance optimization and resource allocation

- **Coordinator**: 112-224-112-56 neurons, ReLU activation
  - Primary: Systems thinking
  - Secondary: Critical thinking
  - Optimized for task distribution and workflow optimization

### 2. Cognitive Diversity Patterns

Six cognitive patterns that influence agent behavior:

- **Convergent**: Focused problem-solving, analytical thinking
- **Divergent**: Creative exploration, idea generation
- **Lateral**: Non-linear thinking, pattern breaking
- **Systems**: Holistic view, interconnections
- **Critical**: Evaluation, judgment, validation
- **Abstract**: Conceptual thinking, generalization

### 3. Intelligent Task Analysis

Neural agents analyze tasks to determine:
- Complexity level
- Urgency
- Creativity requirements
- Data intensity
- Collaboration needs
- Confidence in execution

### 4. Learning Feedback Loops

Agents learn from task execution through:
- Performance metric tracking
- Neural network weight updates
- Cognitive state adjustments
- Experience-based task similarity matching

### 5. Cognitive State Management

Each agent maintains cognitive state:
- **Attention**: Focus level (0.0-1.0)
- **Fatigue**: Exhaustion level (0.0-1.0)
- **Confidence**: Self-assurance (0.0-1.0)
- **Exploration**: Risk-taking tendency (0.0-1.0)

## Usage

### Spawning Neural Agents

```bash
# Spawn with neural capabilities (default)
npx ruv-swarm spawn researcher my-researcher

# Spawn without neural enhancement
npx ruv-swarm spawn coder my-coder --no-neural
```

### Neural Management Commands

```bash
# View neural agent status
npx ruv-swarm neural status

# Train agents with sample tasks
npx ruv-swarm neural train 20

# View cognitive patterns
npx ruv-swarm neural patterns

# Save neural states
npx ruv-swarm neural save neural-states.json

# Load neural states
npx ruv-swarm neural load neural-states.json
```

### Intelligent Task Orchestration

```bash
# Orchestrate with neural task routing
npx ruv-swarm orchestrate "Analyze performance data and optimize system"

# Orchestrate without neural enhancement
npx ruv-swarm orchestrate "Simple task" --no-neural
```

## MCP Integration

Neural capabilities are exposed through MCP tools:

- `neural_status`: Get neural agent status and metrics
- `neural_train`: Train agents with iterations
- `neural_patterns`: Query cognitive pattern information

## Implementation Details

### Neural Network Class

The `NeuralNetwork` class implements:
- Forward propagation with configurable activation functions
- Backpropagation with momentum
- Xavier/Glorot weight initialization
- Serialization for persistence

### NeuralAgent Class

Wraps base agents with:
- Neural task analysis
- Learning history management
- Performance metric tracking
- Cognitive state management
- Rest and recovery functions

### Task Vector Encoding

Tasks are converted to neural input vectors using:
- Text length and complexity metrics
- Priority encoding
- Dependency count
- Historical performance data
- Current cognitive state

## Performance Considerations

- Neural processing adds ~10-50ms per task analysis
- Memory overhead: ~5MB per neural agent
- Learning improves task routing accuracy over time
- Cognitive fatigue simulation prevents overload

## Future Enhancements

1. **Distributed Learning**: Share learning across agent swarms
2. **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models for common tasks
3. **Adaptive Architecture**: Dynamic neural network resizing
4. **Multi-Modal Input**: Support for image/audio task inputs
5. **Reinforcement Learning**: Advanced reward-based optimization

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Initialize swarm
npx ruv-swarm init mesh 10

# 2. Spawn diverse neural agents
npx ruv-swarm spawn researcher alice
npx ruv-swarm spawn coder bob
npx ruv-swarm spawn analyst carol
npx ruv-swarm spawn optimizer dave
npx ruv-swarm spawn coordinator eve

# 3. Train agents
npx ruv-swarm neural train 50

# 4. Check performance
npx ruv-swarm neural status

# 5. Execute complex task
npx ruv-swarm orchestrate "Build a recommendation system with real-time analytics"

# 6. Save learned states
npx ruv-swarm neural save trained-agents.json
```
