# ruv-swarm Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup and reorganization of the ruv-swarm project structure.

## Root Folder Cleanup

### Moved to `/docs/reports/`
- `FINAL_PERFORMANCE_VALIDATION_REPORT.md`
- `LSTM_TRAINING_COMPLETE.md`

### Moved to `/docs/implementation/`
- `MCP_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- `DEPLOYMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`
- `CLAUDE_HOOKS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (from npm/docs)
- `NEURAL_AGENTS.md` (from npm/docs)
- `NPM_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` (from npm/)

### Moved to `/docs/guides/`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

### Created
- `/docs/README.md` - Central documentation index

## NPM Folder Cleanup

### Created Directories
- `/npm/config/` - Configuration files
- `/npm/test-reports/` - Test result files
- `/npm/docs/` - NPM-specific documentation

### Moved Files
- Configuration files → `/npm/config/`
  - `jest.config.js`
  - `rollup.config.js`
  - `webpack.config.js`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - `ruv-swarm.config.json`
  - Created symlinks for files needed in root

- Test reports → `/npm/test-reports/`
  - `test-report-*.json`
  - `mcp-test-results.json`

- Scripts → `/npm/scripts/`
  - `mcp-server.sh`

- Old CLI versions → `/npm/bin/archive/`
  - `ruv-swarm.js`
  - `ruv-swarm-enhanced.js`

### Updated Files
- `/npm/.gitignore` - Added new directories
- `/npm/wasm/.gitignore` - Created for WASM binaries
- `/npm/docs/README.md` - Created NPM documentation index

## Result
The project structure is now cleaner and more organized:
- Documentation is centralized in `/docs/`
- NPM package has its own organized structure
- Configuration files are grouped together
- Test reports are separated from source code
- Old/archived files are moved out of active directories

## Quick Setup
For Claude Code integration with hooks:
```bash
npx ruv-swarm init --claude --force
```

This creates a fully configured environment with:
- Automatic agent coordination
- Code formatting hooks
- Neural pattern learning
- Session persistence
