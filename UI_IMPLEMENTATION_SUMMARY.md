# Claude-Flow UI Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a text-based process management UI for Claude-Flow v1.0.43.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Pure JavaScript UI
- **File**: `/src/cli/simple-commands/process-ui.js`
- **Why**: The TypeScript version had import assertion issues with Deno 2.x
- **Features**:
  - Interactive process management for 6 core processes
  - Real-time status display
  - Simple keyboard controls
  - Color-coded status indicators

### 2. UI Features
- **Process Management**:
  - Event Bus
  - Orchestrator
  - Memory Manager
  - Terminal Pool
  - MCP Server
  - Coordinator

- **Controls**:
  - `1-6`: Select and toggle specific process
  - `A`: Start all processes
  - `Z`: Stop all processes
  - `R`: Restart all processes
  - `Q`: Quit UI

- **Visual Elements**:
  - Color-coded status: ● (running/green), ○ (stopped/gray)
  - Process information: PID and uptime
  - Clear navigation with highlighted selection

### 3. Integration
- Modified `/src/cli/simple-commands/start-wrapper.js` to launch UI when `--ui` flag is used
- Kept binary using `simple-cli.js` to avoid Deno import issues
- UI launches successfully with `./bin/claude-flow start --ui`

### 4. Testing Results
- UI launches and displays correctly
- All keyboard commands work as expected
- Process start/stop simulation functions properly
- Clean exit with 'q' command

## Usage
```bash
# Launch the UI
./bin/claude-flow start --ui

# Or with global installation
claude-flow start --ui
```

## Technical Notes
- Used ANSI escape codes for colors and cursor control
- Implemented simple stdin reading for cross-platform compatibility
- Avoided TypeScript/Cliffy dependencies that caused import errors
- Simulated process management (not connected to actual processes yet)

## Future Enhancements
- Connect to actual process management backend
- Add real process monitoring
- Implement log viewing
- Add configuration options
- Support for more advanced terminal features
