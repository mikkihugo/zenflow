# Clean Package Architecture - Coordination-Led System

## Final Architecture Overview

### Package Responsibilities

#### 🏭 Coordination Packages (Orchestrators)
- **@claude-zen/coordination** - Enterprise orchestration
- **TaskMaster** - SAFe 6.0 workflows and governance
- **SPARC** - 5-phase development methodology
- **Role**: Orchestrate and coordinate all other packages

#### 🧠 Brain Package (Neural Processing)
- **Domain**: Neural networks, WASM acceleration, AI inference
- **Role**: Specialized ML computation processor
- **Usage**: Coordinated by coordination packages

#### 🗃️ FACT System (Execution Caching)  
- **Domain**: API responses, computation results, execution outputs
- **Role**: Fast caching to avoid re-execution
- **Events**: `fact:store`, `fact:query`, `fact:status`
- **Usage**: Event-driven through coordination packages

#### 📚 Knowledge System (Semantic Processing)
- **Domain**: Documentation, RAG, semantic understanding  
- **Role**: Domain knowledge and analysis
- **Events**: None - internal processing only
- **Usage**: Direct internal usage by coordination packages

### Clean Communication Flow

```
Coordination (TaskMaster/SPARC)
├── events → FACT System (execution caching)
├── direct → Knowledge System (semantic processing)
├── events → Brain System (neural processing)
└── events → Other domain packages
```

### No Cross-Package Communication

❌ **Eliminated:**
- knowledge ↔ fact direct communication
- brain → other packages orchestration
- Complex cross-package event flows

✅ **Clean Separation:**
- Each package has single domain responsibility
- Coordination packages handle orchestration
- Brain focuses purely on neural processing
- Simple, predictable communication patterns

### Enterprise Benefits

✅ **SAFe 6.0 Compliance** - TaskMaster handles enterprise governance  
✅ **SPARC Methodology** - Structured development phases  
✅ **Clean Architecture** - Single responsibility per package  
✅ **Scalable Coordination** - Enterprise-ready orchestration patterns  
✅ **Testing Isolation** - Each package tests independently  
✅ **Domain Focus** - Each package optimized for its specific domain  

This architecture follows enterprise patterns and ensures clean separation of concerns with proper coordination-led orchestration.
