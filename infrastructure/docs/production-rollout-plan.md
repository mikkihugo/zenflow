## Pre-Deployment Phase

### T-7 Days: Infrastructure Preparation

## Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Database Preparation (09:00 - 10:00)

#### 1.1 Database Backup
```bash
# Create pre-deployment backup
for service in business core swarm development; do
  ./scripts/backup-database.sh production $service "pre-deployment-$(date +%Y%m%d)"
done
```

#### 1.2 Database Migrations
```bash
# Run migrations in transaction
for service in business core swarm development; do
  kubectl exec -n vision-to-code-production deployment/${service}-service -- \
    mix ecto.migrate --log-sql
done
```

#### 1.3 Migration Validation
```sql
-- Verify schema versions
SELECT schema_version, migrated_at 
FROM schema_migrations 
ORDER BY version DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Phase 2: Blue Environment Deployment (10:00 - 11:30)

#### 2.1 Deploy Blue Environment
```bash
# Deploy new version to blue environment
./infrastructure/scripts/deploy.sh deploy production $VERSION

# Monitor deployment
./infrastructure/scripts/monitor-deployment.sh production 600
```

#### 2.2 Blue Environment Testing
```bash
# Run smoke tests against blue
./infrastructure/scripts/smoke-tests.sh production-blue

# Performance baseline
./scripts/performance-test.sh production-blue --duration 300
```

#### 2.3 Blue Environment Validation
- [ ] All pods running and ready
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Database connections established
- [ ] External service integrations verified
- [ ] Metrics being collected

### Phase 3: Canary Deployment (11:30 - 13:00)

#### 3.1 Enable Canary Traffic (5%)
```bash
# Route 5% traffic to blue
kubectl patch virtualservice vision-to-code \
  -n vision-to-code-production \
  --type merge \
  -p '{"spec":{"http":[{"match":[{"headers":{"canary":{"exact":"true"}}}],"route":[{"destination":{"host":"vision-to-code-blue","port":{"number":80}},"weight":100}]},{"route":[{"destination":{"host":"vision-to-code-green","port":{"number":80}},"weight":95},{"destination":{"host":"vision-to-code-blue","port":{"number":80}},"weight":5}]}]}}'
```

#### 3.2 Canary Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor canary metrics
./scripts/monitor-canary.sh production 1800

# Compare error rates
./scripts/compare-deployments.sh green blue
```

#### 3.3 Canary Progression
- 5% traffic - 30 minutes
- 10% traffic - 20 minutes
- 25% traffic - 20 minutes
- 50% traffic - 20 minutes

### Phase 4: Full Traffic Switch (13:00 - 14:00)

#### 4.1 Final Validation
```bash
# Comprehensive health check
./scripts/health-check-all.sh production-blue

# Load test at 50% traffic
./scripts/load-test-canary.sh production 600
```

#### 4.2 Traffic Cutover
```bash
# Switch 100% traffic to blue
./infrastructure/scripts/switch-traffic.sh production blue

# Monitor for 15 minutes
./infrastructure/scripts/monitor-deployment.sh production 900
```

#### 4.3 Green Environment Retention
```bash
# Keep green environment for quick rollback
# Do not destroy for 24 hours
kubectl annotate deployment -n vision-to-code-production \
  -l deployment-color=green \
  keep-until="$(date -d '+24 hours' --iso-8601=seconds)"
```

### Phase 5: Post-Deployment Validation (14:00 - 15:00)

# API integration tests
./scripts/test-api-integration.sh production
```

#### 5.2 Performance Validation
```bash
# Baseline performance test
./benchmark/run-performance-tests.py \
  --environment production \
  --duration 1800 \
  --save-baseline
```

#### 5.3 Security Scanning
```bash
# Security vulnerability scan
