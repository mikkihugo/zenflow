## üîß Usage Examples

### **Immediate Benefits (No Code Changes)**
```typescript
// Existing code continues to work
const client = createAPIClient(config);

// But now gains UACL monitoring and health checks automatically
```

### **Enhanced Usage (Optional Migration)**
```typescript
// Drop-in enhanced replacements
const { client, instance } = await createEnhancedAPIClient('my-api', config);

// Gains: health monitoring, metrics, auto-reconnection, failover
```

### **Full UACL Usage (Maximum Benefits)**
```typescript
await uacl.initialize();
const httpClient = await uacl.createHTTPClient('api', 'https://api.com');
const health = uacl.getHealthStatus();
const metrics = uacl.getMetrics();
```
