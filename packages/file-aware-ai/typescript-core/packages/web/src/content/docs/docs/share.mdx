description: Share your opencode conversations.
---

opencode's share feature allows you to create public links to your opencode conversations, so you can collaborate with teammates or get help from others.

:::note
Shared conversations are publicly accessible to anyone with the link.
:::

---

## How it works

When you share a conversation, opencode:

1. Creates a unique public URL for your session
2. Syncs your conversation history to our servers
3. Makes the conversation accessible via the shareable link â€” `opencode.ai/s/<share-id>`

---

## Sharing

You can manually share a conversation or enable automatic sharing for all new conversations.

---

### Manual

Use the `/share` command in any conversation to create a shareable link:

```
/share
```

This will generate a unique URL that'll be copied to your clipboard.

---

### Autoshare

You can enable automatic sharing for all new conversations through the `autoshare` option in your [config file](/docs/config).

```json title="opencode.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "autoshare": true
}
```

By default, `autoshare` is disabled.

---

## Unsharing

To stop sharing a conversation and remove it from public access:

```
/unshare
```

This will remove the share link and delete the data related to the conversation.

---

## Privacy

There are a few things to keep in mind when sharing a conversation.

---

### Data retention

Shared conversations remain accessible until you explicitly unshare them. This
includes:

- Full conversation history
- All messages and responses
- Session metadata

---

### Recommendations

- Only share conversations that don't contain sensitive information
- Review conversation content before sharing
- Unshare conversations when collaboration is complete
- Avoid sharing conversations with proprietary code or confidential data

---

## For enterprises

For enterprise deployments, the share feature can be:

- **Self-hosted** on your own infrastructure
- **Restricted** to authenticated users only
- **Disabled** entirely for security compliance
