## 🚀 Quick Start

```typescript
import { NeuralForecast, models } from '@zen-ai/neural-forecasting';

// Create LSTM model for 12-step ahead forecasting
const lstm = new models.LSTM({
  hiddenSize: 128,
  numLayers: 2,  
  horizon: 12,
  inputSize: 24
});

// Create forecasting pipeline
const nf = new NeuralForecast()
  .addModel(lstm)
  .build();

// Train on time series data
await nf.fit(trainingData);

// Generate forecasts
const forecasts = await nf.predict();
```
