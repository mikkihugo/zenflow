# @claude-zen/events (Shim)

This package is a thin compatibility layer. All event mechanics and contracts are provided by `@claude-zen/foundation`.

- Use `@claude-zen/foundation/events` for EventBus, registry, catalog, and contracts.
- Existing imports from `@claude-zen/events` will continue to work by re-exporting foundation.
