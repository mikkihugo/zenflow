# 🕳️ TIER 5: DEEP CORE PACKAGES

## 💀 ULTRA-MAXIMUM SECURITY: DEEP CORE SYSTEM PROTECTION

**These are DEEP CORE packages. NEVER modify unless absolutely critical emergency with multiple expert confirmations.**

### 🎯 What This Tier Contains:
Ultra-restricted foundation systems with limited access:
- `dspy` - DSPy optimization engine (only accessible via brain package)
- `neural-ml` - Neural ML core systems (only accessible via brain package)  
- `fact-system` - Core fact management (only accessible via knowledge package)
- `memory-root` - Deep memory management systems

### ✅ EXTREMELY LIMITED ALLOWED Operations:
- **Read files** for emergency debugging only (with multiple confirmations)
- **Answer theoretical questions** about concepts (general only)

### 🚫 ABSOLUTELY NEVER (Unless Critical Emergency + Multiple Expert Confirmations):
- **Creating any files** in deep core packages
- **Modifying ultra-restricted systems** 
- **Changing neural network foundations**
- **Breaking deep core dependencies**
- **Exposing deep core APIs** to any other system

### 🔐 Ultra-Maximum Security:
- All packages marked `"private": true, "access": "deepcore"`
- **ONLY** accessible by specific Tier 3 packages:
  - `dspy` → ONLY via `tier3-internal/brain`
  - `neural-ml` → ONLY via `tier3-internal/brain`  
  - `fact-system` → ONLY via `tier3-internal/knowledge`
- Contains fundamental system runtime and neural foundations

### 📋 Instructions for Claude Code:
1. **ULTRA-MAXIMUM CAUTION**: Foundation-level systems
2. **EMERGENCY ONLY**: Only modify in critical emergencies
3. **MULTIPLE EXPERT CONFIRMATIONS**: Require user + expert approval
4. **SYSTEM FOUNDATION**: Changes here affect everything
