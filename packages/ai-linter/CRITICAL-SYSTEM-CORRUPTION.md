# CRITICAL SYSTEM-LEVEL CORRUPTION DISCOVERED

## Issue Summary
Even after completely deleting `.pnpm` directory and all `node_modules`, then performing fresh `pnpm install`, the **SAME CORRUPTION PATTERNS** persist in newly downloaded packages.

## Evidence
1. **Deleted entire .pnpm directory**: `rm -rf node_modules/.pnpm`
2. **Deleted entire node_modules**: `rm -rf node_modules`  
3. **Fresh install**: `pnpm install` (2611 packages downloaded fresh)
4. **Same corruption exists**: `@types/glob/index.d.ts` and `minimatch/dist/commonjs/index.d.ts` still corrupted

## Corruption Patterns Found in Fresh Packages
- Union type corruption: `string | number` → `string'' | '''' | ''number`
- Import statement corruption: `} from "module";` → `} from "module");`
- Template literal corruption: `${var || other}` → `${var'' | '''' | ''other}`

## Critical Implications
This is **NOT** a pnpm cache issue - it's a **SYSTEM-LEVEL** issue affecting:
- Package download process
- File system operations
- Text processing during install
- Potentially system-wide find/replace corruption

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Test with npm instead of pnpm to isolate package manager
2. Check system-level processes that might be modifying files
3. Test on different machine/environment
4. Consider system-wide malware or corruption tool running

## Technical Impact
- 7000+ TypeScript compilation errors
- All @types packages affected
- Server cannot start
- Development completely blocked
