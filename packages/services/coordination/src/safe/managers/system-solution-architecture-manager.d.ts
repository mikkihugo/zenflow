 * Delegates to: * - SystemDesignManagementService: System design creation and lifecycle management
 * - ComplianceMonitoringService: Automated compliance validation and monitoring
 * - ArchitectureReviewManagementService: Architecture review workflows and coordination
 *
 * REDUCTION: 860 â†’ ~300 lines (~65% reduction) through service delegation
