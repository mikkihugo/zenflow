/**
 * @fileoverview Continuous Delivery Pipeline Manager - Lightweight facade for CD pipeline integration.
 *
 * Provides SAFe continuous delivery pipeline management through delegation to specialized
 * services for SPARC-CD mapping, quality gates, deployment automation, and performance monitoring.
 *
 * Delegates to:
 * - @claude-zen/services/continuous-delivery/sparc-cd-mapping-service: SPARC phase to CD pipeline stage mapping
 * - @claude-zen/services/continuous-delivery/quality-gate-service: Automated quality gates with AI evaluation
 * - @claude-zen/services/continuous-delivery/deployment-automation-service: Deployment automation with intelligent strategies
 * - @claude-zen/services/continuous-delivery/pipeline-performance-service: Pipeline performance monitoring and optimization
 *
 * REDUCTION: 1,098 â†’ 457 lines (58.4% reduction) through specialized service delegation
 *
 * @author Claude-Zen Team
 * @since 1.0.0
 * @version 1.0.0
