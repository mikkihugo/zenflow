# 🔐 TIER 3: INTERNAL CORE PACKAGES

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: INTERNAL SYSTEM PROTECTION

**These are INTERNAL CORE packages. DO NOT modify unless explicitly instructed and confirmed.**

### 🎯 What This Tier Contains:
Advanced coordination and internal systems:
- `brain`, `knowledge`, `workflows`
- `safe-framework`, `sparc`, `teamwork`
- `agui`, `code-analyzer`, `git-operations`
- `singularity-coder`, `enterprise-coordination`
- Advanced neural and architectural systems

### ✅ ALLOWED Operations:
- **Read files** for understanding internal architecture
- **Analyze complex systems** for debugging
- **Answer questions** about internal coordination

### 🚫 FORBIDDEN Operations (Unless Explicitly Instructed):
- **Creating files** in internal packages
- **Modifying core systems** without confirmation
- **Changing internal APIs** that other systems depend on
- **Breaking internal coordination** patterns

### 🔐 Access Control:
- All packages marked `"private": true, "access": "internal"`
- **NOT** in workspace catalog
- Only accessible via Tier 1 facades or Tier 2 implementations
- Core system coordination and neural networks

### 📋 Instructions for Claude Code:
1. **EXTREME CAUTION**: These systems coordinate complex operations
2. **ASK MULTIPLE TIMES**: Confirm before any changes to internal systems
3. **READ-ONLY PREFERRED**: Understand before modifying
4. **SYSTEM INTEGRITY**: Don't break internal coordination
