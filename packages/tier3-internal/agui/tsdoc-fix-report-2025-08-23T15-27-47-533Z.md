üìä Missing Documentation: 2 exports
üéØ Target: 100% TSDoc coverage
üèóÔ∏è Project: claude-code-zen (AI swarm orchestration platform)

üìã ANALYSIS REPORT:
Current Coverage: 0% (2 undocumented exports)
Export Types: 2 consts
Priority: HIGH
File Complexity: Simple
Recommendation: Focus on AGUI_VERSION, AGUI_DESCRIPTION

SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS:
You are a technical documentation expert specializing in TypeScript and TSDoc/JSDoc standards.
Your task is to add comprehensive, professional-grade documentation to TypeScript exports.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. ONLY add documentation comments - DO NOT modify any existing code
2. Follow TSDoc/JSDoc standards exactly (/** */ syntax)
3. Place documentation immediately above each export
4. Maintain existing code formatting and structure
5. Use consistent style with any existing documentation in the file

DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS:
- Use /** */ for all documentation blocks
- Start descriptions with capital letters, end with periods
- Use present tense ("Creates a..." not "Will create a...")
- Be specific about functionality, constraints, and side effects
- Include @param, @returns, @throws, @example, @since tags as appropriate
- Use @see tags to reference related functions/classes
- Add realistic @example blocks for complex functionality

USER TASK:
Add comprehensive TSDoc documentation to this TypeScript file for the following undocumented exports:

- AGUI_VERSION (const) at line 75
- AGUI_DESCRIPTION (const) at line 76

QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:
1. ‚úÖ Clear, concise descriptions of what each export does
2. ‚úÖ Complete @param documentation with types and descriptions
3. ‚úÖ Accurate @returns documentation for all functions
4. ‚úÖ @throws documentation for functions that can throw errors
5. ‚úÖ @example blocks for complex or important functionality
6. ‚úÖ @since 1.0.0 tags for version tracking
7. ‚úÖ Professional tone suitable for API documentation
8. ‚úÖ Consistency with existing documentation style in the file

CONTEXT GUIDELINES:
- This is part of the claude-code-zen AI swarm orchestration platform
- Focus on practical usage and integration points
- Mention important performance, security, or architectural considerations
- Use domain-appropriate terminology (agents, swarms, coordination, etc.)
- Link related exports using @see tags when helpful


Please analyze the file context and add high-quality TSDoc documentation that meets professional standards. was not found.


## Original Analysis
### index.ts
- **Coverage**: 0%
- **Missing Documentation**: 2 exports
- **Export Types**: 2 consts
- **Exports Needing Documentation**:
  - `AGUI_VERSION` (const) at line 75
  - `AGUI_DESCRIPTION` (const) at line 76

## Recommendations
### Next Steps
2. **Address Failed Files**: Check error messages and manually review files that failed processing
3. **Quality Review**: Manually review generated documentation for accuracy and completeness
4. **Integration**: Run `pnpm docs:check-strict` to verify all documentation meets requirements
5. **Maintenance**: Set up CI/CD checks to maintain documentation quality over time
