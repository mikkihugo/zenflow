# Maestro TODO List

This document outlines the remaining tasks, future enhancements, and areas for improvement for the Maestro specs-driven development framework.

## High Priority

*   [ ] **Complete `LivingDocumentationSync` Implementation:** The framework for living documentation is in place, but the core synchronization logic needs to be fully implemented. This includes:
    *   Change detection between spec and code files.
    *   Conflict resolution strategies.
    *   Applying changes to files.
*   [ ] **Flesh out `AgentHookEngine` Actions:** The engine can trigger hooks, but the actions themselves (e.g., `runQualityCheck`, `spawnBackgroundAgent`) need to be fully implemented.
*   [ ] **Implement `PatternLearningEngine`:** The engine is currently a placeholder. The core logic for learning from successful and unsuccessful workflows needs to be implemented.

## Medium Priority

*   [ ] **Enhance CLI Command Logic:** The CLI commands are functional, but could be improved with more robust error handling, better status reporting, and more detailed feedback to the user.
*   [ ] **Improve Steering Context:** The `getSteeringContext` method is currently a placeholder. It should be updated to conditionally load steering documents based on the agent type and the context of the task.
*   [ ] **Refine Agent Capabilities:** The agent templates in `agent-manager.ts` should be reviewed and refined to ensure they have the appropriate capabilities and expertise for their roles in the Maestro workflow.

## Low Priority

*   [ ] **Add More Granular Configuration:** The `MaestroConfig` interface can be expanded to provide more granular control over the various features of the framework.
*   [ ] **Improve Test Coverage:** Add more comprehensive unit and integration tests for the Maestro components, especially for the advanced features like consensus and living documentation.
*   [ ] **Expand Documentation:** The documentation is a good start, but it could be expanded with more detailed examples, tutorials, and API references.

## Future Enhancements

*   [ ] **Parallel Task Execution:** The `implement-task` command currently executes tasks sequentially. The framework could be enhanced to support parallel execution of tasks with dependency management.
*   [ ] **Cross-Project Intelligence:** The `PatternLearningEngine` could be extended to share knowledge and patterns across multiple projects.
*   [ ] **Enterprise Integration:** The framework could be integrated with enterprise systems like Jira, GitHub, and Jenkins for a more seamless development experience.
