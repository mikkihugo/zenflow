**Implementation approach:**
```typescript
class FACTExternalOrchestrator {
  private wasmFact: WASMFactIntegration;
  private externalMCP: ExternalMCPClient;
  
  async gatherKnowledge(query: string): Promise<FACTResult> {
    // 1. Use WASM FACT for caching and processing
    const cached = await this.wasmFact.checkCache(query);
    if (cached) return cached;
    
    // 2. Distribute query to external MCPs in parallel
    const results = await Promise.all([
      this.externalMCP.query('context7', query),
      this.externalMCP.query('deepwiki', query),
      this.externalMCP.query('gitmcp', query),
      this.externalMCP.query('semgrep', query)
    ]);
    
    // 3. Process with WASM cognitive templates
    const processed = await this.wasmFact.processTemplate(results);
    
    // 4. Cache and return
    await this.wasmFact.cache(query, processed);
    return processed;
  }
}
```
