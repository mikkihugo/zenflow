      "content": "# Bazel Migration Guide for Singularity Engine\n\n## 🚀 Prerequisites\n\nBefore starting the migration, ensure Bazel is installed:\n\n```bash\n# Option 1: Use Nix (includes Bazel automatically)\nnix develop\n\n# Option 2: Install system-wide\n./scripts/install-bazel.sh\n\n# Verify installation\nbazel --version  # Should show 7.1.0 (via .bazelversion)\n```\n\n## Overview\n\nThis guide documents the migration from Nx to Bazel for the Singularity Engine monorepo. Bazel provides hermetic builds, better caching, and true polyglot support for our diverse technology stack.\n\n## Current Status\n\n✅ **Completed:**\n\n- Bazel 7.1.0 configured with Bzlmod\n- Custom rules for Elixir and Gleam created\n- Nix flake updated with Bazel and all language toolchains\n- Core BUILD.bazel files created for active services\n- Migration helper script created\n\n🚧 **In Progress:**\n\n- Converting remaining Nx project.json files to BUILD.bazel\n- Setting up inter-project dependencies\n- Configuring remote caching\n\n## Technology Stack Support\n\n### ✅ Supported Languages\n\n1. **Elixir** (Custom Rules)\n\n   - `elixir_library` - For libraries\n   - `elixir_binary` - For executables\n   - Toolchain: Elixir 1.18 + OTP 28\n\n2. **Gleam** (Custom Rules)\n\n   - `gleam_library` - For libraries\n   - `gleam_binary` - For executables\n   - Targets: Erlang and JavaScript\n\n3. **TypeScript/JavaScript**\n\n   - Using `@aspect_rules_ts` and `@rules_nodejs`\n   - SWC for fast transpilation\n   - Full npm/pnpm support\n\n4. **Go**\n\n   - Using `@rules_go` and Gazelle\n   - Automatic BUILD file generation\n\n5. **Rust**\n\n   - Using `@rules_rust`\n   - Cargo integration\n\n6. **Python**\n   - Using `@rules_python`\n   - pip integration\n\n## Quick Start\n\n```bash\n# Enter Nix development shell (includes Bazel)\nnix develop\n\n# Build everything\nbazel build //...\n\n# Run tests\nbazel test //...\n\n# Build specific target\nbazel build //active-services/hex-server\n\n# Run specific service\nbazel run //active-services/storage-service\n```\n\n## Migration Steps\n\n### 1. Automatic Migration\n\nUse the migration helper script for basic conversion:\n\n```bash\n./scripts/migrate-nx-to-bazel.sh\n```\n\n### 2. Manual Adjustments\n\nAfter running the script, you'll need to:\n\n1. **Update Dependencies**: Add explicit dependencies between targets\n2. **Configure Tests**: Ensure test targets are properly configured\n3. **Handle Assets**: Add filegroup rules for non-code files\n4. **Set Visibility**: Adjust visibility rules as needed\n\n### 3. Example Conversions\n\n#### TypeScript Service (from Nx)\n\n```javascript\n// project.json\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-service\",\n  \"tags\": [\"tech:typescript\", \"type:service\"]\n}\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```python\n# BUILD.bazel\nload(\"//bazel:nx_migration.bzl\", \"nx_typescript_service\")\n\nnx_typescript_service(\n    name = \"my-service\",\n    tags = [\"tech:typescript\", \"type:service\"],\n)\n```\n\n#### Elixir Service\n\n```python\n# BUILD.bazel\nload(\"//bazel:elixir_rules.bzl\", \"elixir_binary\", \"elixir_library\")\n\nelixir_library(\n    name = \"storage_lib\",\n    srcs = glob([\"lib/**/*.ex\"]),\n    mix_exs = \"mix.exs\",\n)\n\nelixir_binary(\n    name = \"storage-service\",\n    srcs = glob([\"lib/**/*.ex\"]),\n    mix_exs = \"mix.exs\",\n    main_module = \"StorageService.Application\",\n    deps = [\":storage_lib\"],\n)\n```\n\n## Key Differences from Nx\n\n1. **Explicit Dependencies**: Bazel requires explicit declaration of all dependencies\n2. **Hermetic Builds**: Builds are isolated and reproducible\n3. **Language-Specific Rules**: Each language has its own rule set\n4. **No Implicit Graph**: Dependencies must be explicitly stated\n5. **Better Caching**: Content-addressed caching across all builds\n\n## Build Performance\n\n### Local Caching\n\n```bash\n# Enable disk cache\nbuild --disk_cache=~/.cache/bazel-disk-cache\n```\n\n### Remote Caching (Future)\n\n```bash\n# Configure remote cache server\nbuild --remote_cache=grpc://your-cache-server:9090\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Common Issues\n\n1. **Missing Dependencies**\n\n   ```\n   ERROR: missing dependency '@npm//some-package'\n   ```\n\n   Solution: Add to package.json and run `bazel run @npm//:npm install`\n\n2. **Elixir/Gleam Compilation Errors**\n\n   ```\n   ERROR: mix command not found\n   ```\n\n   Solution: Ensure you're in `nix develop` shell\n\n3. **Test Failures**\n   ```\n   ERROR: test timeout\n   ```\n   Solution: Increase timeout in test rule: `timeout = \"long\"`\n\n## CI/CD Integration\n\nUpdate your CI pipelines to use Bazel:\n\n```yaml\n# GitHub Actions example\n- name: Setup Bazel\n  uses: bazelbuild/setup-bazel@v1\n  with:\n    bazel-version: \"7.1.0\"\n\n- name: Build\n  run: bazel build //...\n\n- name: Test\n  run: bazel test //...\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Use Macros**: Create reusable macros for common patterns\n2. **Minimize Globs**: Be specific about source files when possible\n3. **Tag Everything**: Use tags for organization and filtering\n4. **Version Lock**: Pin all external dependencies\n5. **Clean Regularly**: Run `bazel clean` to free disk space\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Complete migration of all project.json files\n2. Set up remote caching infrastructure\n3. Optimize build performance\n4. Create custom lint rules\n5. Integrate with deployment pipelines\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Bazel Documentation](https://bazel.build)\n- [Bazel for Elixir (Custom)](./bazel/elixir_rules.bzl)\n- [Bazel for Gleam (Custom)](./bazel/gleam_rules.bzl)\n- [Migration Script](./scripts/migrate-nx-to-bazel.sh)\n",
