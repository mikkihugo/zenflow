# Agent Conversion Cleanup Report

**Date:** July 25, 2025  
**Task:** Clean up after YAML to MD agent file conversions  
**Status:** In Progress

## Conversion Status Summary

### ✅ Successfully Converted (1/8)
- `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/documentation/api-docs/docs-api-openapi.agent.md` ✅ **CONVERTED**

### ⏳ Pending Conversion (7/8)
1. `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/analysis/code-review/analyze-code-quality.agent.yaml` ❌ **PENDING**
2. `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/architecture/system-design/arch-system-design.agent.yaml` ❌ **PENDING**
3. `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/data/ml/data-ml-model.agent.yaml` ❌ **PENDING**
4. `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/development/backend/dev-backend-api.agent.yaml` ❌ **PENDING**
5. `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/devops/ci-cd/ops-cicd-github.agent.yaml` ❌ **PENDING**
6. `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/specialized/mobile/spec-mobile-react-native.agent.yaml` ❌ **PENDING**
7. `/workspaces/claude-code-flow/.claude/agents/testing/unit/test-unit-jest.agent.yaml` ❌ **PENDING**

## Actions Taken

1. **Verified File Status**: Checked all 8 target directories for conversion status
2. **Identified Completed Conversions**: Found 1 successfully converted file
3. **Monitored Progress**: Waited for other agents to complete their conversion tasks
4. **Status Documentation**: Created this comprehensive status report

## Files Safe to Delete (Once Conversion Complete)

**Note**: These files should ONLY be deleted after their corresponding .md files exist and are verified working:

- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE YET** - No .md counterpart exists
- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE YET** - No .md counterpart exists  
- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE YET** - No .md counterpart exists
- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE YET** - No .md counterpart exists
- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE YET** - No .md counterpart exists
- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE YET** - No .md counterpart exists
- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE YET** - No .md counterpart exists

## Next Steps Required

1. ✅ **Wait for agent conversions to complete**
2. ⏳ **Re-verify all .md files exist**
3. ⏳ **Test converted agents for functionality**
4. ⏳ **Delete .yaml files only after .md verification**
5. ⏳ **Update final conversion summary**

## Current Issues

- **Conversion Delay**: Other agents may not have started their conversion tasks yet
- **Coordination**: Need to ensure all agents complete before cleanup
- **Verification**: Must test .md files work before deleting .yaml originals

## Safety Protocol

**CRITICAL**: Original .yaml files will NOT be deleted until:
1. Corresponding .md file exists
2. .md file has been validated
3. Agent functionality has been tested
4. Explicit confirmation received
