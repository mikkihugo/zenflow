# Enhanced security scanning configuration for claude-code-zen
# Comprehensive analysis covering all security aspects

# Note: paths-ignore is not supported in CodeQL config files for most languages
# Use workflow-level path filtering instead

# Enable all default queries for comprehensive coverage
disable-default-queries: false

# Use comprehensive security and quality queries
queries:
  - uses: security-extended
  - uses: security-and-quality
  
# Additional query packs for comprehensive analysis
