## ðŸŽ¨ Vision-to-Code Issue

### **Context**
This issue is part of implementing the vision-to-code pipeline that converts visual designs into working code components.

### **Component Type**
- [ ] Image processing/analysis
- [ ] Component detection (buttons, forms, layouts)
- [ ] Code generation (React/Vue/Angular)
- [ ] Styling extraction (CSS/SCSS)
- [ ] Responsive design handling
- [ ] Interactive annotation system

### **Problem Statement**
<!-- Describe what vision processing functionality needs to be implemented -->

### **Expected Outcome**
<!-- What should be generated from visual inputs -->

### **Technical Requirements**
- [ ] Image processing pipeline
- [ ] ML model integration for component detection
- [ ] Code generation templates
- [ ] Styling analysis and conversion

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] 75%+ design accuracy in component detection
- [ ] 60%+ generated code usability without manual fixes
- [ ] Support for common UI patterns
- [ ] Responsive design generation

### **Input/Output Examples**
```
Input: [Design file - PNG/JPG/Figma]
Output: [Generated component code]
```

### **Dependencies**
- [ ] Vision Queen implementation
- [ ] Neural network models for image analysis
- [ ] Code generation templates
- [ ] Component library integrations
