## ðŸ‘‘ Multi-Queen System Issue

### **Context**
This issue is part of implementing the distributed multi-Queen architecture for collaborative AI decision-making.

### **Queen Type**
- [ ] Code Queen (generation/refactoring)
- [ ] Debug Queen (error detection/fixing)
- [ ] Test Queen (test generation/validation)
- [ ] Architecture Queen (design decisions)
- [ ] Vision Queen (design-to-code)
- [ ] Queen Coordination/Consensus

### **Problem Statement**
<!-- Describe what Queen functionality needs to be implemented -->

### **Expected Outcome**
<!-- How Queens should collaborate after this issue is resolved -->

### **Technical Requirements**

- [ ] Consensus algorithm implementation
- [ ] Load balancing/failover
- [ ] Performance monitoring

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Queens can communicate and reach consensus
- [ ] 85%+ consensus quality vs human expert
- [ ] 80%+ task routing accuracy
- [ ] Graceful handling of Queen failures

### **Integration Points**
- [ ] SQLite memory sharing
- [ ] Vector database for semantic consensus
- [ ] Graph database for Queen relationships
