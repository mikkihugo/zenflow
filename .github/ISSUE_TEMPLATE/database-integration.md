## üóÑÔ∏è Database Integration Issue

### **Database Type**
- [ ] LanceDB (Vector Database)
- [ ] Kuzu (Graph Database)
- [ ] SQLite optimizations
- [ ] PostgreSQL enterprise features
- [ ] Cross-database operations

### **Context**
This issue is part of implementing the advanced database stack for semantic search, relationship mapping, and intelligent memory systems.

### **Problem Statement**
<!-- Describe what database functionality needs to be implemented -->

### **Expected Outcome**
<!-- What database operations should work after implementation -->

### **Technical Requirements**
- [ ] Database client/connection management
- [ ] Query optimization and indexing
- [ ] Data migration and schema management
- [ ] Integration with existing SQLite system

### **Performance Requirements**
- [ ] <100ms vector search queries
- [ ] <10ms graph traversal operations
- [ ] 90%+ relationship mapping accuracy
- [ ] Concurrent user support (1K+)

### **Acceptance Criteria**
- [ ] Database integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

### **Integration Points**
- [ ] Queen memory sharing
- [ ] Neural network embeddings
- [ ] CLI command integration
- [ ] Web interface queries

### **Data Models**
<!-- Describe schemas, indexes, relationships -->

### **Related Issues**
<!-- Link to other database issues -->
