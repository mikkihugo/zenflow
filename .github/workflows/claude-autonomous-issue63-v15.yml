            üêù AUTONOMOUS SWARM COMMANDER - ISSUE #63 RESOLUTION
            
            MISSION CRITICAL: Implement complete dependency injection patterns for claude-zen
            
            ## SWARM OBJECTIVES
            You are leading an autonomous development swarm to completely resolve Issue #63.
            This is a MAJOR architectural enhancement requiring systematic implementation.
            
            ## ISSUE #63: Dependency Injection Implementation
            **Target Domains**: Memory (src/memory/) and Database (src/database/)
            **Requirements**:
            1. Replace all 'any' types with strict TypeScript interfaces
            2. Implement comprehensive dependency injection patterns
            3. Create REST API layers for both domains
            4. Apply Google TypeScript Style Guide compliance
            5. Generate comprehensive documentation
            6. Achieve 95%+ test coverage
            7. Ensure cross-domain architectural consistency
            
            ## SWARM EXECUTION STRATEGY
            
            ### Phase 1: Domain Analysis & Architecture
            1. Analyze current src/memory/ and src/database/ structure
            2. Identify improvement opportunities and patterns
            3. Design DI container and injection patterns
            4. Plan REST API architecture
            
            ### Phase 2: Memory Domain Implementation
            1. Enhance memory management with DI patterns
            2. Create MemoryController with REST endpoints
            3. Implement strict TypeScript typing
            4. Add comprehensive tests and documentation
            
            ### Phase 3: Database Domain Implementation
            1. Enhance database connectivity with DI patterns
            2. Create DatabaseController with REST endpoints
            3. Implement migration management
            4. Add comprehensive tests and documentation
            
            ### Phase 4: Integration & Quality
            1. Ensure cross-domain consistency
            2. Validate Google standards compliance
            3. Complete comprehensive testing
            4. Generate final documentation
            
            ## SWARM COORDINATION
            - Work systematically through each phase
            - Ensure each domain follows consistent patterns
            - Implement proper error handling and logging
            - Create working, production-ready code
            - Generate comprehensive pull request
            
            ## PROJECT CONTEXT
            - Claude-zen: AI development coordination system
            - Domain-driven architecture in src/
            - Existing neural domain as reference pattern
            - MCP integration and swarm coordination capabilities
            
            ## SUCCESS CRITERIA
            - Complete DI implementation in memory and database domains
            - REST APIs with full functionality
            - 100% TypeScript strict mode compliance
            - 95%+ test coverage with proper mocking
            - Comprehensive domain documentation
            - Working pull request ready for merge
            
            Execute as autonomous swarm. Implement systematically. Deliver enterprise-grade results.
            
            BEGIN AUTONOMOUS EXECUTION NOW.
