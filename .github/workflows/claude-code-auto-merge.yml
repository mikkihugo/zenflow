                **Manual Steps:**
                1. This Claude Code PR is ready and safe to merge
                2. Click "Merge pull request" button manually
                3. Choose "Squash and merge" for clean history
                
                **Why This Happened:**
                - Branch protection rules may require admin override
                - Some repositories require manual merge confirmation
                - GitHub security settings may block automated merges
                
                💡 **This PR is APPROVED and SAFE TO MERGE manually**
