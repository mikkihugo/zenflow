# .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
# This workflow configures the isolated development environment used by the GitHub Copilot coding agent.
# The agent is hardcoded to look for this specific file path and the job ID 'copilot-setup-steps'.
# Adherence to this naming convention is mandatory for the custom setup to be recognized. [1, 2]

  # This workflow is triggered on-demand by the Copilot coding agent.
  # The 'workflow_dispatch' trigger also allows for manual runs from the GitHub Actions tab for testing and validation. [2]

    # It is critical to set 'continue-on-error' to true. If a setup step fails (e.g., a package registry is temporarily unavailable),
    # this ensures the workflow completes. The agent can then log the setup failure and attempt to proceed,
    # rather than crashing the entire session. This provides valuable debugging information. [1, 4]

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout Repository Code
      # This step checks out the repository's code so that subsequent steps can access project files
      # like package.json, Cargo.toml, and requirements.txt.
      # Using v4 is crucial as it runs on a supported Node.js 20 runtime, avoiding deprecation warnings. [7]
      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Setup Node.js v22 Environment
      # Configures the Node.js environment using the official GitHub Action.

        with:
      # Specify '22.x' to automatically use the latest available patch release for Node.js v22.

          # Enable built-in caching for pnpm. This significantly speeds up subsequent runs by caching dependencies.

          cache: 'pnpm'

      # Step 3: Setup PNPM
      # This step installs pnpm itself, which is required before we can install the project dependencies.
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v4

      # Optional: show pnpm store path (helpful when checking cache hits in logs)
      - name: Show pnpm store path
        run: pnpm store path
          
      # Step 4: Install Node.js Dependencies
      # Use 'pnpm install' instead of 'npm ci'. 'pnpm install' provides faster, more reliable, and deterministic builds
      # by installing dependencies directly from the 'pnpm-lock.yaml' file, which is ideal for CI environments. [10]

          # are essential tools for maintaining code quality. [11, 12]
          components: rustfmt, clippy
          # The 'cache' input is enabled by default and is a key feature. It intelligently caches the Cargo registry,
          # git dependencies, and compiled dependency artifacts to dramatically reduce build times. [11]
