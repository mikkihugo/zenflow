# .github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml
# This workflow configures the isolated development environment used by the GitHub Copilot coding agent.
# The agent is hardcoded to look for this specific file path and the job ID 'copilot-setup-steps'.
# Adherence to this naming convention is mandatory for the custom setup to be recognized. [1, 2]

  # This workflow is triggered on-demand by the Copilot coding agent.
  # The 'workflow_dispatch' trigger also allows for manual runs from the GitHub Actions tab for testing and validation. [2]

    # It is critical to set 'continue-on-error' to true. If a setup step fails (e.g., a package registry is temporarily unavailable),
    # this ensures the workflow completes. The agent can then log the setup failure and attempt to proceed,
    # rather than crashing the entire session. This provides valuable debugging information. [1, 4]
