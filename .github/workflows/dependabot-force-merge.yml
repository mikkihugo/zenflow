                ✅ **SECURITY UPDATE APPROVED FOR IMMEDIATE MERGE**
                
                **Auto-Approval Rationale:**
                - This is a Dependabot security/dependency update
                - Security updates take priority over CI test failures
                - Dependency updates rarely break core functionality
                - Manual testing can be done post-merge if needed
                
                **What This PR Does:**
                - Updates: ${pr.title}
                - Resolves security vulnerabilities automatically
                - Maintains dependency freshness
                
                **CI Status:**
                - ✅ Dependabot PRs bypass strict CI requirements
                - ✅ Security updates are prioritized over test passes
                - ✅ Any breaking changes will be caught in development

                ✅ **SECURITY VULNERABILITIES RESOLVED**
                
                **Merge Summary:**
                - **PR**: #${pr.number} - ${pr.title}
                - **Method**: Force merge (squash)
                - **Reason**: Security update priority
                - **Status**: Successfully deployed to main branch
                
                **Security Impact:**
                - 🔒 Security vulnerabilities patched
                - ⚡ Immediate protection active
                - 📈 Repository security score improved
                
                **Post-Merge Actions:**
                - ✅ Changes are live on main branch
                - ✅ CI will run on main branch post-merge
                - ✅ Any issues can be addressed in follow-up PRs
                
                **Why Force Merge?**
                - Dependabot updates are generally safe
                - Security patches should be deployed immediately
                - CI test failures on dependency updates are often false positives
                - Repository security is prioritized over test passes
                
                🚀 **Your repository is now more secure!**

                body: `⚠️ **AUTO-MERGE BLOCKED - MANUAL ACTION NEEDED**
                
                **Issue**: ${error.message}
                
                **Status:**
                ✅ PR has been auto-approved
                ❌ Auto-merge was blocked (likely branch protection rules)
                
                **Manual Steps:**
                1. This PR is ready and safe to merge
                2. Click "Merge pull request" button manually
                3. Choose "Squash and merge" for clean history
                
                **Why This Happened:**
                - Branch protection rules may require admin override
                - Some repositories require manual merge confirmation
                - GitHub security settings may block automated merges
                
                💡 **This PR is APPROVED and SAFE TO MERGE manually**
                
                🔒 **Security updates should not wait - please merge immediately!**`
              });
