---

## ðŸ“Š **Contract Interfaces Defined**

### **Core Contracts**
```typescript
interface WebApiContract {
  start(port: number): Promise<void>;
  registerRoute(method: string, path: string, handler: Function): void;
  getRoutes(): Array<{ method: string; path: string }>;
}

interface McpServerContract {
  initialize(options: { stdio: boolean }): Promise<void>;
  handleStdioMessage(message: any): Promise<any>;
  registerTool(name: string, handler: Function): void;
}

interface WebSocketContract {
  createServer(port: number): Promise<void>;
  broadcast(event: string, data: any): void;
  onConnection(handler: Function): void;
}

interface HiveMindContract {
  spawnQueen(type: string, config: any): Promise<string>;
  coordinateQueens(task: any): Promise<any>;
  getQueenStatus(): Promise<Array<{ id: string; type: string; status: string }>>;
}
```

### **Integration Contracts**
```typescript
interface IntegrationLayerContract {
  bridgeWebToMcp(request: any): Promise<any>;
  bridgeMcpToWeb(mcpResponse: any): Promise<any>;
  coordinateComponents(): Promise<void>;
}

interface RequestTransformationContract {
  httpToMcp(httpRequest: any): any;
  mcpToHttp(mcpResponse: any): any;
  validateTransformation(original: any, transformed: any): boolean;
}
```

## ðŸŽ¨ **London School Patterns Demonstrated**

### **1. Interaction Testing Over State Testing**
- Focus on verifying conversations between objects
- Mock expectations define the contract behavior
- Test the collaboration patterns, not internal state

### **2. Mock-Driven Interface Design**
- Mocks help discover optimal component interfaces
- Contract definitions emerge from test requirements
- Clear separation of responsibilities through mock boundaries

### **3. Outside-In Development Flow**
- Start with acceptance tests defining user behavior
- Drive down to unit tests through mock contracts
- Implement just enough to satisfy the test contracts

### **4. Behavior Verification**
- Verify HOW components interact with each other
- Assert on method calls, parameters, and call sequences
- Focus on the component conversation, not implementation details

---

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Implementation**

### **Next Steps for Development Teams**

1. **Run the Test Suite**:
   ```bash
   npm run test:tdd-london
   ```

2. **Implement Against Contracts**:
   - Use the mock contracts as implementation guides
   - Focus on satisfying the behavioral expectations
   - Maintain the interaction patterns defined in tests

3. **Follow London School Principles**:
   - Mock all collaborators to isolate units
   - Test behavior, not implementation
   - Keep tests focused on component contracts
   - Use mocks to drive interface design

4. **Iterative Development**:
   - Red: Write failing test with mock expectations
   - Green: Implement just enough to pass the test
   - Refactor: Improve design while maintaining contracts

## ðŸ“ˆ **Benefits Achieved**

### **For Claude-Zen Development**
- âœ… **Clear Component Boundaries**: Well-defined contracts between all components
- âœ… **Testable Architecture**: Every component interaction is verified through tests
- âœ… **Design Guidance**: Mocks provide clear implementation direction
- âœ… **Refactoring Safety**: Behavior contracts protect against breaking changes

### **For Team Coordination**
- âœ… **Shared Understanding**: Contract interfaces provide common vocabulary
- âœ… **Parallel Development**: Teams can work independently against mock contracts
- âœ… **Integration Confidence**: All interactions are pre-verified through tests
- âœ… **Quality Assurance**: Behavior-driven development ensures user requirements

## ðŸ”® **Future Enhancements**

### **Proposed ruv-FANN â†’ ruv-FANN-zen Renaming**
**Status**: Ready for implementation (see `RENAMING-PROPOSAL.md`)
- Reflects extensive Claude-Zen specific modifications
- Distinguishes from upstream ruv-FANN project
- Aligns with @claude-zen/monorepo branding

### **Additional Test Coverage**
- Performance testing with London School principles
- Cross-platform compatibility verification
- Load testing for Queen coordination systems
- Security testing for authentication workflows
