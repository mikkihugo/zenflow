# Swarm-Per-Microservice Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
Implementation plan for deploying one dedicated swarm per microservice in the Singularity Engine architecture.

## Phase 1: Meta Registry Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

### 1.1 Core Meta Registry Service
```elixir
# Location: /home/mhugo/code/singularity-engine/services/coordination/meta-registry/
# Files to create:
- lib/meta_registry.ex                 # Core registry service
- lib/meta_registry/discovery.ex      # Service discovery 
- lib/meta_registry/task_router.ex    # Cross-swarm routing
- lib/meta_registry/health_monitor.ex # Global health monitoring
- config/meta_registry_config.exs     # Configuration
```

### 1.2 Service Discovery Protocol
- Implement registration/deregistration API
- Health check endpoints for all services
- Capability indexing system
- Load balancing algorithms

### 1.3 Communication Infrastructure
- Inter-swarm message bus
- Task delegation protocols
- Conflict resolution mechanisms
- Global memory coordination

## Phase 2: High-Priority Swarm Implementation (Weeks 3-4)

### 2.1 AI Service Swarm
```bash
# Integration with existing AI service
cd /home/mhugo/code/singularity-engine/active-services/ai-service/
# Add swarm functionality:
- lib/ai_service/swarm/queen.ex
- lib/ai_service/swarm/agents/model_selector.ex
- lib/ai_service/swarm/agents/provider_manager.ex
- lib/ai_service/swarm/memory.ex
```

### 2.2 Storage Service Swarm
```bash
cd /home/mhugo/code/singularity-engine/active-services/storage-service/
# Add swarm functionality:
- lib/storage_service/swarm/queen.ex
- lib/storage_service/swarm/agents/consistency.ex
- lib/storage_service/swarm/agents/backup.ex
- lib/storage_service/swarm/memory.ex
```

### 2.3 Core Service Swarm  
```bash
cd /home/mhugo/code/singularity-engine/active-services/core-service/
# Add swarm functionality for health monitoring
- lib/core_service/swarm/queen.ex
- lib/core_service/swarm/agents/health_monitor.ex
- lib/core_service/swarm/agents/system_coordinator.ex
```

## Phase 3: Remaining Service Swarms (Weeks 5-6)

### 3.1 Business Logic Services
- **Business Service** swarm for workflow management
- **Architecture Service** swarm for system design  
- **Interface Service** swarm for user interactions

### 3.2 Operational Services
- **Execution Service** swarm for task processing
- **Infra Service** swarm for resource management
- **Tools Service** swarm for development support

### 3.3 Specialized Services
- **Security Service** swarm (Gleam) for auth/security
- **Hex Server** swarm (Gleam) for package management
- **ML Service** swarm for machine learning

## Phase 4: Integration & Optimization (Weeks 7-8)

### 4.1 Cross-Swarm Coordination
- Task delegation optimization
- Load balancing across swarms
- Global memory synchronization
- Conflict resolution testing

### 4.2 Monitoring & Observability
- Swarm health dashboards
- Performance metrics collection
- Cross-swarm communication monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- Agent specialization tuning
- Memory optimization per service
- Task routing efficiency improvements
- Caching strategies per swarm

## Technical Implementation Details

### Meta Registry Startup Sequence
```elixir
# 1. Start Meta Registry service (port 4100)
SingularityEngine.MetaRegistry.start_link()

# 2. Each service registers its swarm
AiService.Swarm.Queen.register_with_meta_registry()
StorageService.Swarm.Queen.register_with_meta_registry()
# ... other services

# 3. Cross-swarm communication established
MetaRegistry.establish_communication_channels()
```

### Service Swarm Integration Pattern
```elixir
# Each service gets enhanced with swarm capabilities
defmodule ServiceName.Application do
  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      # Existing service components
      ServiceName.Endpoint,
      ServiceName.Repo,
      
      # New swarm components  
      ServiceName.Swarm.Supervisor,
      ServiceName.Swarm.Queen,
      ServiceName.Swarm.MetaClient
    ]
    
    Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
  end
end
```

### Task Delegation Example
```elixir
# AI Service needs storage for model cache
task = %{
  type: :cache_model,
  model_id: "claude-3.5-sonnet",
  cache_duration: 3600,
  priority: :high
}

# Queen delegates to storage service through meta registry
AiService.Swarm.Queen.delegate_task(:data_persistence, task)
  |> MetaRegistry.route_task(:storage_service)
  |> StorageService.Swarm.Queen.execute_task()
```

## Success Metrics

### Performance Goals
- **Service Response Time**: <100ms for intra-swarm tasks
- **Cross-Swarm Latency**: <50ms for task delegation
- **System Uptime**: 99.9% with swarm fault tolerance
- **Resource Efficiency**: 30% improvement in resource utilization

### Capability Goals  
- **Service Autonomy**: Each service operates independently
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Optimal task routing across swarms
- **Fault Tolerance**: Graceful degradation per service
- **Scalability**: Independent scaling per service swarm

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Meta Registry SPOF**: Implement HA configuration with backup registries
2. **Cross-Swarm Latency**: Optimize communication protocols and caching
3. **Memory Synchronization**: Use eventual consistency where possible
4. **Service Discovery Issues**: Implement health checks and automatic recovery

### Migration Risks
1. **Service Disruption**: Blue-green deployment strategy
2. **Data Consistency**: Careful coordination during swarm enablement  
3. **Performance Regression**: Comprehensive monitoring during rollout
4. **Rollback Complexity**: Maintain legacy swarm service as fallback

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve** architecture design
2. **Set up Development Environment** for meta registry
3. **Begin Phase 1 Implementation** with meta registry core
4. **Establish Testing Strategy** for swarm coordination
5. **Create Monitoring Infrastructure** for observability

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to implementing the swarm-per-microservice architecture while maintaining system stability and enabling gradual migration.
