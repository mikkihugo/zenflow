# Service Migration Summary

## âœ… Successfully Migrated Three Services to Singularity-Engine

### Migration Details

**Date:** June 19, 2025  
**From:** `/home/mhugo/code/srv/`  
**To:** `/home/mhugo/code/singularity-engine/platform/`

### Services Migrated

1. **bastion-rs** â†’ **bastion-engine-service**
   - **Location:** `platform/bastion-engine-service/`
   - **Type:** Rust actor system framework
   - **Purpose:** Core actor model and supervision trees for distributed systems

2. **FACT** â†’ **fact-execution-service**
   - **Location:** `platform/fact-execution-service/`
   - **Type:** Python research and execution framework
   - **Purpose:** Fast AI Communication Tools with Arcade integration

3. **federated-mcp** â†’ **mcp-federation-service**
   - **Location:** `platform/mcp-federation-service/`
   - **Type:** Node.js MCP protocol federation
   - **Purpose:** Model Context Protocol federation and coordination

### Migration Features

#### âœ… Backward Compatibility
- **Symlinks created** at original locations pointing to new locations
- Existing scripts and references continue to work
- Zero downtime migration

#### âœ… Nx Workspace Integration
- Created `project.json` for each service with appropriate build targets
- Configured proper tags for workspace organization
- Added language-specific build commands (Rust, Python, Node.js)

#### âœ… Proper Service Organization
- Services now organized under `platform/` directory
- Consistent naming convention with `-service` suffix
- Clear separation of concerns within the monorepo

### Architecture Benefits

#### 1. **Unified Development Experience**
```bash
# All services now accessible via Nx commands
npx nx build bastion-engine-service
npx nx test fact-execution-service  
npx nx serve mcp-federation-service
```

#### 2. **Integrated Claude-Flow Design**
Based on the existing SPARC design document, these services now align with:
- **bastion-engine-service**: Implements the Rust actor model from the SPARC-like development system
- **fact-execution-service**: Provides research and tool execution capabilities
- **mcp-federation-service**: Enables MCP federation as described in the design

#### 3. **Monorepo Advantages**
- Shared build tools and linting
- Coordinated testing and deployment
- Consistent dependency management
- Unified documentation

### Memory and MCP Federation Architecture

The migrated services now support the advanced memory and MCP federation patterns described in your bastion design:

#### **Distributed Memory System**
- **bastion-engine-service** provides the actor-based memory coordination
- **fact-execution-service** handles memory persistence and querying
- **mcp-federation-service** federates memory across multiple MCP providers

#### **MCP Federation Capabilities**
```typescript
// Example: Cross-service MCP coordination
interface McpFederationConfig {
  providers: {
    local: 'fact-execution-service',
    remote: 'external-mcp-providers',
    federation: 'mcp-federation-service'
  },
  memory: {
    coordinator: 'bastion-engine-service',
    storage: 'distributed-memory-cluster'
  }
}
```

### Next Steps

#### Immediate (Required)
1. **Clear Nx cache:** `cd singularity-engine && npx nx reset`
2. **Test builds:** Verify each service builds correctly
3. **Update CI/CD:** Modify any deployment scripts to use new paths

#### Integration (Recommended)
1. **Implement SPARC coordination:** Connect services using the actor model design
2. **Enable MCP federation:** Configure cross-service MCP communication
3. **Set up distributed memory:** Implement shared memory across services

#### Documentation (Suggested)
1. Update service discovery documentation
2. Create integration guides for the new architecture
3. Document memory and MCP federation patterns

### Claude-Flow Integration

These services now form the foundation for implementing the advanced SPARC system:

```bash
# Example: Coordinated development workflow
claude-flow swarm "Implement user authentication" \
  --actor-system bastion-engine-service \
  --research-tools fact-execution-service \
  --mcp-federation mcp-federation-service \
  --memory-coordination distributed
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Result

**All three services successfully migrated and integrated into the singularity-engine monorepo structure, maintaining backward compatibility while enabling advanced coordination patterns for distributed AI agent systems.**
