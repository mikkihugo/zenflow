# NPM Package Testing Summary

## Executive Summary
The ruv-swarm npm package v1.0.5 has been thoroughly tested in a Docker environment. While the global installation works correctly with all core functionality operational, there are two critical issues preventing full functionality:

1. **Local npx execution fails** due to syntax errors in wasm-loader.js
2. **WASM files are missing** from the global npm package distribution

## Test Coverage
- ✅ Global installation via `npm install -g ruv-swarm`
- ✅ All CLI commands functional (init, spawn, status, mcp)
- ✅ Claude Code integration successful
- ✅ Graceful fallback to placeholder WASM implementations
- ❌ Local npx execution blocked by syntax errors
- ❌ WASM module loading fails (files missing from npm package)

## Critical Issues

### Issue 1: Syntax Error in wasm-loader.js
**Location**: `/node_modules/ruv-swarm/src/wasm-loader.js:255`
**Problem**: Method bodies contain literal `\n` escape sequences instead of actual newlines
**Impact**: Prevents npx execution from local node_modules
**Fix Required**: Proper source file formatting during build/publish

### Issue 2: Missing WASM Files in NPM Package
**Problem**: WASM binaries not included in published npm package
**Evidence**: 
- Local installation has all WASM files (167KB .wasm, JS bindings, loader)
- Global installation only has README.md in wasm directory
**Impact**: Falls back to placeholder implementations, losing performance benefits
**Fix Required**: Ensure WASM files are included during npm publish

## Functionality Status
Despite the issues, the package provides:
- ✅ Complete CLI interface
- ✅ Swarm initialization and management
- ✅ Agent spawning and coordination
- ✅ MCP server functionality
- ✅ Claude Code integration with documentation generation
- ⚠️ Degraded performance due to WASM placeholders

## Recommended Actions
1. **Immediate**: Fix wasm-loader.js formatting issue
2. **Immediate**: Include WASM files in npm package
3. **Testing**: Add automated tests for npm package integrity
4. **Documentation**: Update README with known issues and workarounds

## User Workaround
Users can currently use the global installation:
```bash
npm install -g ruv-swarm
ruv-swarm init --claude
```

This provides full functionality with performance warnings that can be safely ignored for development use.
