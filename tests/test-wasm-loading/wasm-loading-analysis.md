# WASM Loading Analysis for ruv-swarm

## Issues Found

### 1. **WASM Files Missing from Published NPM Package**
- The `.gitignore` file in the `wasm/` directory is preventing WASM files from being included in the git repository
- While the files are listed in package.json's `files` array, they're not being tracked by git
- This causes the published npm package to only contain README.md in the wasm directory

### 2. **Incorrect WASM Loading Strategy**
- The `wasm-loader.js` is trying to instantiate the WASM module directly using WebAssembly.instantiate()
- This fails because the WASM file was generated by wasm-bindgen and expects specific imports (the "wbg" module)
- The correct approach is to use the generated `ruv_swarm_wasm.js` file which handles all the wasm-bindgen setup

### 3. **File System API Issues**
- The code imports `{ promises as fs }` but then tries to use `fs.accessSync`
- This causes runtime errors because the promises version doesn't have sync methods
- Fixed by importing `accessSync` separately from 'node:fs'

### 4. **Path Resolution Issues**
- When running from global installation, the baseDir points to the wrong location
- The path candidates are checked but the loader fails to use the correct loading method

## Solutions

### 1. Fix the .gitignore
The `wasm/.gitignore` needs to be updated to track the WASM files:
```gitignore
# Ignore build artifacts but keep essential files
*.log
*.tmp
node_modules/

# Explicitly track important files
!*.wasm
!*.js
!*.mjs
!*.d.ts
!package.json
!README.md
```

### 2. Update wasm-loader.js to Use Proper Loading
Instead of direct WebAssembly.instantiate(), the loader should:
```javascript
// Import the wasm-bindgen generated module
const wasmModule = await import('../wasm/ruv_swarm_wasm.js');

// Read the WASM binary
const wasmBuffer = await fs.readFile(wasmBinaryPath);

// Initialize using the wasm-bindgen init function
await wasmModule.default(wasmBuffer);

// Now all exports are available on wasmModule
return wasmModule;
```

### 3. Fix File System Imports
Already fixed by adding:
```javascript
import { existsSync, accessSync } from 'node:fs';
```

## Verification

The proper loading was verified with this test:
- ✅ WASM module imports successfully
- ✅ WASM binary loads (167516 bytes)
- ✅ Initialization completes
- ✅ Version: 0.1.0
- ✅ Features detected correctly
- ✅ SIMD capabilities reported

## Next Steps

1. Update the wasm-loader.js to use the wasm-bindgen approach
2. Fix the .gitignore to track WASM files
3. Ensure the wasm-bindings-loader.mjs uses the same approach
4. Test the complete flow from npm installation
