# üêù ruv-swarm Comprehensive Test Report

## Executive Summary

This report demonstrates the successful implementation of a test application using ALL ruv-swarm features with proper coordination, parallel execution, and performance optimization.

## üöÄ Features Demonstrated

### 1. Parallel Agent Execution ‚úÖ
- **3 agents spawned in parallel** using BatchTool (single message)
- **Architect, Backend Developer, and Test Engineer** working simultaneously
- All agents followed MANDATORY coordination protocol

### 2. Coordination Tools Usage ‚úÖ

#### Pre-Task Hooks
- Each agent started with `npx ruv-swarm hook pre-task`
- Session restoration with `npx ruv-swarm hook session-restore`
- Context loading before starting work

#### During-Task Hooks
- `npx ruv-swarm hook post-edit` after EVERY file operation
- `npx ruv-swarm hook notification` for decision sharing

#### Post-Task Hooks
- `npx ruv-swarm hook post-task` with performance analysis
- `npx ruv-swarm hook session-end` with metrics export

### 3. Memory Coordination ‚úÖ
