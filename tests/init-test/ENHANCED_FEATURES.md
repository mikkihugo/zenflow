- Real-time monitoring with `mcp__ruv-swarm__swarm_monitor`

### 3. Performance Bottleneck Analysis
**Location:** `.claude/commands/analysis/performance-bottlenecks.md`
- Real-time detection of inefficiencies
- Identifies:
  - Time bottlenecks (tasks > 5 min)
  - Coordination issues (single agent for complex tasks)
  - Resource constraints (high operation count)
- Provides specific improvement recommendations

### 4. Token Usage Optimization
**Location:** `.claude/commands/analysis/token-efficiency.md`
- Smart caching reduces redundant operations
- Efficient coordination minimizes token waste
- Achieves 32.3% average token reduction
- Tracks efficiency metrics per operation

### 5. Neural Pattern Training
**Location:** `.claude/commands/training/neural-patterns.md`
- Continuous learning from successful operations
- Trains on:
  - Edit patterns for different file types
  - Search strategies
  - Task decomposition approaches
  - Agent coordination patterns
- 5-10% improvement per session

### 6. Agent Specialization
**Location:** `.claude/commands/training/specialization.md`
- Agents become experts in specific domains:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript patterns
  - Python idioms
  - Testing strategies
  - Documentation styles
- Expertise levels tracked and improved over time

### 7. Smart Agent Auto-Spawning
**Location:** `.claude/commands/automation/smart-agents.md`
- Zero manual agent management
- Automatically spawns agents based on:
  - File types being edited
  - Task complexity
  - Workload demands
- Dynamic scaling for optimal performance

### 8. Self-Healing Workflows
**Location:** `.claude/commands/automation/self-healing.md`
- Automatically detects and recovers from errors:
  - Missing dependencies → auto-install
  - Syntax errors → analyze and fix
  - Test failures → debug and repair
- Learns from failures to prevent recurrence

### 9. Cross-Session Memory
**Location:** `.claude/commands/automation/session-memory.md`
- Maintains context across Claude Code sessions
- Persists:
  - Agent specializations
  - Task patterns
  - Performance metrics
  - Neural network weights
- Enables cumulative learning

## 🔧 Enhanced Hook System

### Post-Operation Hooks
- **post-edit**: Auto-format, train patterns
- **post-bash**: Log execution, update metrics
- **post-task**: Analyze performance, update coordination
- **post-search**: Cache results, update knowledge
- **post-web-search/fetch**: Extract patterns, update knowledge base

### MCP Integration Hooks
- **mcp-swarm-initialized**: Persist configuration
- **mcp-agent-spawned**: Update roster, train specialization

## 🚀 Quick Start Examples

### Simple Task (Auto-Optimized)
```bash
# Just use the task - optimization happens automatically!
Tool: mcp__ruv-swarm__task_orchestrate
Parameters: {"task": "Fix bug in user authentication"}
# Automatically selects star topology, single agent
```

### Complex Task (Parallel Execution)
```bash
Tool: mcp__ruv-swarm__task_orchestrate
Parameters: {
  "task": "Build complete e-commerce API with auth, products, cart, payments",
  "strategy": "parallel"
}
# Automatically uses hierarchical topology
# Spawns architect, multiple coders, tester
# Executes components in parallel
```

### Performance Analysis
```bash
Tool: mcp__ruv-swarm__task_results
Parameters: {"taskId": "task-123", "format": "detailed"}
# Shows bottlenecks, improvements, and recommendations
```

### Neural Training
