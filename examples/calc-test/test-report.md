## Validation Findings

### Strengths
1. **Correctness**: All arithmetic operations produce correct results
2. **Flexibility**: Supports both two-argument and single-argument (chained) operations
3. **Performance**: Extremely fast execution with minimal memory footprint
4. **Robustness**: Handles edge cases including negative numbers, decimals, and zeros
5. **Isolation**: Multiple instances maintain separate state correctly

### Areas Validated
1. ✅ Basic arithmetic accuracy
2. ✅ State management (result storage)
3. ✅ Method overloading (single vs double argument)
4. ✅ Instance isolation
5. ✅ Edge case handling
6. ✅ Performance and scalability
7. ✅ Memory efficiency

### Potential Improvements
1. Could add division and multiplication operations
2. Could implement operation history/undo functionality
3. Could add input validation for non-numeric values
4. Could implement more advanced operations (square root, percentage, etc.)

## Conclusion

The calculator implementation is **FULLY VALIDATED** and ready for production use. All tests pass successfully, demonstrating:
- Accurate calculations
- Proper state management
- Excellent performance
- Efficient memory usage
