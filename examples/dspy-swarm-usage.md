# DSPy Swarm Usage Examples

## 🧠 **DSPy Intelligent Swarms**

Claude-Zen now features DSPy-powered swarms where each agent is a DSPy program that learns and optimizes over time. This creates truly intelligent agents that improve their performance through continuous learning.

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### 1. Initialize DSPy Swarm via Claude Code

```bash
# Add Claude Zen MCP server to Claude Code
claude mcp add claude-zen-swarm npx claude-zen swarm mcp start

# Use Claude Code to initialize DSPy swarm
claude code "Initialize a DSPy swarm with mesh topology using Claude Sonnet model"
```

**What happens**: Claude Code will use the `dspy_swarm_init` MCP tool to create intelligent agents that are DSPy programs.

### 2. Execute Complex Tasks with Learning

```bash
# Use Claude Code for intelligent task execution
claude code "Generate a TypeScript class for user authentication with DSPy intelligence"
```

**DSPy Enhancement**: The code generation agent learns from previous successful generations and optimizes its prompts automatically.

## 🎯 **Advanced DSPy Swarm Operations**

### **Intelligent Code Generation**

```bash
# Claude Code automatically uses DSPy swarm for code generation
claude code "Create a REST API with authentication, validation, and error handling"
```

**DSPy Intelligence**:
- **Prompt Optimization**: Agent automatically improves its code generation prompts
- **Example Learning**: Learns from successful code patterns
- **Quality Enhancement**: Generates better code with each execution

### **Adaptive Code Analysis**

```bash
# DSPy-powered code analysis with learning
claude code "Analyze the codebase and identify architectural improvements"
```

**DSPy Capabilities**:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns to identify code patterns and anti-patterns
- **Context Awareness**: Understands project-specific requirements
- **Adaptive Suggestions**: Improves recommendations based on feedback

### **Intelligent Architecture Design**

```bash
# DSPy architect agent with domain expertise
claude code "Design a scalable microservices architecture for e-commerce platform"
```

**DSPy Features**:
- **Domain Learning**: Learns architectural patterns specific to different domains
- **Constraint Optimization**: Balances trade-offs intelligently
- **Pattern Application**: Automatically applies learned architectural patterns

## 🔄 **Continuous Learning in Action**

### **Example: Code Generation That Improves**

**First Generation** (Initial accuracy ~80%):
```typescript
// Basic code with standard patterns
class UserService {
  async createUser(data: any) {
    // Basic implementation
  }
}
```

**After Learning** (Improved accuracy ~95%):
```typescript
// Optimized code with learned best practices
class UserService {
  private readonly logger = createLogger({ prefix: 'UserService' });
  
  async createUser(userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<User> {
    this.logger.info('Creating user', { userId: userData.email });
    
    try {
      // Validation, error handling, proper typing
      const validatedData = await this.validateUserData(userData);
      const user = await this.userRepository.create(validatedData);
      
      this.logger.info('User created successfully', { userId: user.id });
      return user;
    } catch (error) {
      this.logger.error('User creation failed', error);
      throw new UserCreationError('Failed to create user', { cause: error });
    }
  }
}
```

### **Performance Metrics**

DSPy agents track and improve their performance:

```bash
# Check DSPy swarm performance
claude code "Show DSPy swarm status and learning metrics"
```
