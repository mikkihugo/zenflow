## Missing: Chairman Approval Backlog

The system has approval mechanisms but appears to be missing a dedicated **Chairman Approval Backlog** service. Here's what should be implemented:

```typescript
// Suggested location: /domains/strategic-domain/chairman-approval-service/

interface ChairmanApprovalRequest {
  id: string;
  requestType: 'strategic' | 'financial' | 'architectural' | 'governance';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  submittedBy: string;
  submittedAt: Date;
  context: string;
  decision: string;
  impact: string;
  alternatives: string[];
  status: 'pending' | 'reviewing' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'deferred';
  chairmanNotes?: string;
  approvalDeadline?: Date;
}

interface ChairmanBacklog {
  pendingApprovals: ChairmanApprovalRequest[];
  inReview: ChairmanApprovalRequest[];
  recentDecisions: ChairmanApprovalRequest[];
  metrics: {
    averageResponseTime: number;
    approvalRate: number;
    deferralRate: number;
  };
}
```

## Integration Points

1. **With Executive Intelligence Service**:
   - Route high-impact decisions to Chairman backlog
   - Track decision outcomes

2. **With SENTINEL Advisory System**:
   - Escalate critical findings to Chairman
   - Emergency override requests

3. **With Guardian Service**:
   - Swedish responsibility chain escalations
   - Budget approvals above thresholds

## Recommended Implementation

Create a dedicated Chairman Approval Service that:
1. Maintains a prioritized backlog of pending approvals
2. Provides Chairman dashboard with decision context
3. Tracks approval metrics and patterns
4. Integrates with PRIME for decision assistance
5. Notifies relevant parties of decisions
6. Maintains audit trail for compliance

This would centralize all Chairman-level approvals and provide visibility into the decision pipeline.
