   - Enhance separation of concerns
   - Optimize facade patterns and delegation
   - Improve service registration and discovery
   - Standardize architectural patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
======================
- Maintain compatibility with existing strategic facade architecture
- Preserve the 6-layer strategic facade system
- Ensure all packages follow consistent patterns
- Optimize for both development and production environments
- Maintain type safety and strict TypeScript compliance
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Follow enterprise-grade best practices

DELIVERABLES:
=============
- Optimized build configuration files
- Enhanced package.json scripts across all packages

- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Clear ownership documentation in code
- Improved service registration patterns
- Production-ready monitoring and health checks
- Optimized import/export structures
- Enhanced development tooling

Please analyze the entire codebase systematically and implement comprehensive improvements that make this a world-class, enterprise-ready TypeScript monorepo with optimal build performance and clear ownership patterns.

PHASE 1 FOCUS: Core build system optimization
TARGET FILES: Root configuration and build system files

Analyze and optimize:
- package.json (root workspace configuration)
- pnpm-workspace.yaml
- tsconfig.json (root TypeScript configuration)
- vitest.config.ts
- .gitignore and build artifacts
- Development scripts and workflows

   - Improve code reusability and maintainability
   - Enhance separation of concerns
   - Optimize facade patterns and delegation
   - Improve service registration and discovery
   - Standardize architectural patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
======================
- Maintain compatibility with existing strategic facade architecture
- Preserve the 6-layer strategic facade system
- Ensure all packages follow consistent patterns
- Optimize for both development and production environments
- Maintain type safety and strict TypeScript compliance
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Follow enterprise-grade best practices

DELIVERABLES:
=============
- Optimized build configuration files
- Enhanced package.json scripts across all packages
- Improved development workflow scripts
- Optimized TypeScript configurations

- Clear ownership documentation in code
- Improved service registration patterns
- Production-ready monitoring and health checks
- Optimized import/export structures
- Enhanced development tooling

Please analyze the entire codebase systematically and implement comprehensive improvements that make this a world-class, enterprise-ready TypeScript monorepo with optimal build performance and clear ownership patterns.

PHASE 2 FOCUS: Package-level build optimization and ownership patterns
TARGET FILES: Individual package configurations

Analyze and optimize each package's:
- package.json configuration and scripts
- tsconfig.json settings
- Build and development workflows
- Dependency management
- Export/import patterns
- Service ownership boundaries

   - Fix any build-time errors or warnings
   - Optimize bundling and compilation processes

2. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Audit and optimize package dependencies
   - Fix any dependency conflicts or vulnerabilities
   - Ensure proper peer dependency management
   - Optimize import/export patterns
   - Clean up unused dependencies
   - Standardize version management across packages

3. OWNERSHIP & RESPONSIBILITY PATTERNS:
   - Establish clear package ownership boundaries
   - Implement proper service ownership patterns
   - Define clear API contracts between packages
   - Establish responsibility delegation patterns
   - Implement proper error ownership and handling
   - Create clear module responsibility definitions

4. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
   - Optimize development server startup times

   - Optimize runtime performance
   - Ensure proper resource management
   - Implement graceful shutdown patterns
   - Add comprehensive observability

6. CODE ORGANIZATION & ARCHITECTURE:
   - Optimize module organization and structure
   - Improve code reusability and maintainability
   - Enhance separation of concerns
   - Optimize facade patterns and delegation
   - Improve service registration and discovery
   - Standardize architectural patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
======================
- Maintain compatibility with existing strategic facade architecture
- Preserve the 6-layer strategic facade system
- Ensure all packages follow consistent patterns
- Optimize for both development and production environments
- Maintain type safety and strict TypeScript compliance
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Follow enterprise-grade best practices

DELIVERABLES:
=============
- Optimized build configuration files
- Enhanced package.json scripts across all packages

   - Optimize bundling and compilation processes

2. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Audit and optimize package dependencies
   - Fix any dependency conflicts or vulnerabilities
   - Ensure proper peer dependency management
   - Optimize import/export patterns
   - Clean up unused dependencies
   - Standardize version management across packages

3. OWNERSHIP & RESPONSIBILITY PATTERNS:
   - Establish clear package ownership boundaries
   - Implement proper service ownership patterns
   - Define clear API contracts between packages
   - Establish responsibility delegation patterns
   - Implement proper error ownership and handling
   - Create clear module responsibility definitions

4. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
   - Optimize development server startup times
   - Improve hot reload and watch mode performance
   - Enhance debugging capabilities

   - Optimize runtime performance
   - Ensure proper resource management
   - Implement graceful shutdown patterns
   - Add comprehensive observability

6. CODE ORGANIZATION & ARCHITECTURE:
   - Optimize module organization and structure
   - Improve code reusability and maintainability
   - Enhance separation of concerns
   - Optimize facade patterns and delegation
   - Improve service registration and discovery
   - Standardize architectural patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
======================
- Maintain compatibility with existing strategic facade architecture
- Preserve the 6-layer strategic facade system
- Ensure all packages follow consistent patterns
- Optimize for both development and production environments
- Maintain type safety and strict TypeScript compliance
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Follow enterprise-grade best practices

DELIVERABLES:
=============
- Optimized build configuration files
- Enhanced package.json scripts across all packages
- Improved development workflow scripts
- Optimized TypeScript configurations
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Clear ownership documentation in code
- Improved service registration patterns
- Production-ready monitoring and health checks
- Optimized import/export structures
- Enhanced development tooling

Please analyze the entire codebase systematically and implement comprehensive improvements that make this a world-class, enterprise-ready TypeScript monorepo with optimal build performance and clear ownership patterns.

PHASE 4 FOCUS: Server application build and runtime optimization  
TARGET FILES: Main server application

Optimize the core server application:
- Build performance and startup time
- Development workflow optimization
- Production deployment readiness
- Service ownership and responsibility patterns
- Error handling and monitoring
