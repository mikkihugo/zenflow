# Comprehensive build optimization prompt
BUILD_OPTIMIZATION_PROMPT="COMPREHENSIVE BUILD & OWNERSHIP OPTIMIZATION TASK

MISSION: Transform this TypeScript monorepo into a production-ready, enterprise-grade system with optimal build performance, clear ownership patterns, and robust development workflows.

FOCUS AREAS:
============

1. BUILD SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION:
   - Analyze and optimize pnpm workspace configuration
   - Improve TypeScript build performance across packages
   - Enhance development and production build scripts
   - Optimize package.json scripts and dependencies
   - Implement efficient build caching strategies
   - Fix any build-time errors or warnings
   - Optimize bundling and compilation processes

2. DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT:
   - Audit and optimize package dependencies
   - Fix any dependency conflicts or vulnerabilities
   - Ensure proper peer dependency management
   - Optimize import/export patterns
   - Clean up unused dependencies
   - Standardize version management across packages

3. OWNERSHIP & RESPONSIBILITY PATTERNS:
   - Establish clear package ownership boundaries
   - Implement proper service ownership patterns
   - Define clear API contracts between packages
   - Establish responsibility delegation patterns
   - Implement proper error ownership and handling
   - Create clear module responsibility definitions

4. DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
   - Optimize development server startup times
   - Improve hot reload and watch mode performance
   - Enhance debugging capabilities
   - Optimize test execution performance
   - Improve linting and type checking workflows
   - Standardize development scripts across packages

5. PRODUCTION READINESS:
   - Ensure robust error handling and logging
   - Implement proper health checks and monitoring
   - Optimize runtime performance
   - Ensure proper resource management
   - Implement graceful shutdown patterns
   - Add comprehensive observability

6. CODE ORGANIZATION & ARCHITECTURE:
   - Optimize module organization and structure
   - Improve code reusability and maintainability
   - Enhance separation of concerns
   - Optimize facade patterns and delegation
   - Improve service registration and discovery
   - Standardize architectural patterns

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
======================
- Maintain compatibility with existing strategic facade architecture
- Preserve the 6-layer strategic facade system
- Ensure all packages follow consistent patterns
- Optimize for both development and production environments
- Maintain type safety and strict TypeScript compliance
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible
- Follow enterprise-grade best practices

DELIVERABLES:
=============
- Optimized build configuration files
- Enhanced package.json scripts across all packages
- Improved development workflow scripts
- Optimized TypeScript configurations
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Clear ownership documentation in code
- Improved service registration patterns
- Production-ready monitoring and health checks
- Optimized import/export structures
- Enhanced development tooling

Please analyze the entire codebase systematically and implement comprehensive improvements that make this a world-class, enterprise-ready TypeScript monorepo with optimal build performance and clear ownership patterns."
