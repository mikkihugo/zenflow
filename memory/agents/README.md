# Agents Directory

This directory stores agent-specific memory and state information.

## Structure
Each agent gets its own subdirectory named by agent ID:
- `agent-001/`: First agent's memory
- `agent-002/`: Second agent's memory
- etc.

## Files per Agent
- `profile.json`: Agent configuration and capabilities
- `memory.md`: Agent's working memory
- `tasks.json`: Assigned tasks and their status
- `metrics.json`: Performance metrics

## Usage
Files in this directory are automatically managed by the Claude-Flow system.
