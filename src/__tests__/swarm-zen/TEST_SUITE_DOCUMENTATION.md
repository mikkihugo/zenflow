## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Exhaustion**
   - **Symptom**: Tests fail with out-of-memory errors
   - **Solution**: Increase Node.js heap size with `--max-old-space-size=4096`

2. **Timeout Failures**
   - **Symptom**: Tests timeout during execution
   - **Solution**: Increase timeout values or run tests individually

3. **File System Permissions**
   - **Symptom**: Cannot create test files or directories
   - **Solution**: Ensure write permissions in test directory

4. **Port Conflicts**
   - **Symptom**: Integration tests fail to bind ports
   - **Solution**: Ensure test ports are available or use dynamic port allocation

### Debug Mode

Enable debug output for troubleshooting:

```bash
DEBUG=session-persistence:* node test/issue-137-test-runner.js --verbose
```

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Tests

When adding tests to the suite:

1. **Follow Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive test names
2. **Include Documentation**: Document test purpose and expectations
3. **Use Test Factories**: Leverage existing data generation utilities
4. **Add Performance Tracking**: Include timing measurements where relevant
5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error states

### Test Organization

Tests are organized by:

- **Component**: Group tests by the component being tested
- **Type**: Separate unit, integration, and performance tests
- **Complexity**: Order from simple to complex scenarios
- **Dependencies**: Minimize test interdependencies

### Mocking Strategy

- **External Dependencies**: Mock all external services and databases
- **Time-Dependent Code**: Mock Date and timing functions where needed
- **Random Values**: Use deterministic random values for reproducible tests
- **Network Calls**: Mock all network requests and responses

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Extended Chaos Scenarios**: Additional failure types and combinations
2. **Performance Regression Testing**: Automated performance trend analysis
3. **Security Testing**: Vulnerability assessment and penetration testing
