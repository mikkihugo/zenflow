/**
 * SPARC-Swarm Integration Summary.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED: Database-driven + SPARC Swarm Integration.
 *
 * Architecture Overview:
 * ===================.
 *
 * 1. DATABASE-DRIVEN PRODUCT FLOW (WHAT to build)
 *    Vision â†’ ADRs â†’ PRDs â†’ Epics â†’ Features â†’ Tasks
 *    - Uses DatabaseDrivenSystem for orchestration
 *    - Features and Tasks are database entities
 *    - Follows business requirements workflow.
 *
 * 2. SPARC METHODOLOGY (HOW to implement)
 *    Specification â†’ Pseudocode â†’ Architecture â†’ Refinement â†’ Completion
 *    - Applied by SPARCSwarmCoordinator when processing Features/Tasks
 *    - Uses specialized agents for each phase
 *    - Provides systematic implementation approach.
 *
 * 3. INTEGRATION BRIDGE
 *    DatabaseSPARCBridge connects the flows:
 *    - Receives Features/Tasks from database-driven system
 *    - Assigns to SPARC swarm for implementation
 *    - Coordinates agent specialization per SPARC phase
 *    - Returns implementation artifacts to database.
 *
 * Component Integration:
 * ====================.
 *
 * DatabaseDrivenSystem
 *   â†“ (generates Features/Tasks)
 * DatabaseSPARCBridge
 *   â†“ (assigns work)
 * SPARCSwarmCoordinator
 *   â†“ (applies SPARC methodology)
 * Specialized Agents (per phase)
 *   â†“ (produces artifacts)
 * Database (stores results).
 *
 * Key Features Implemented:
 * ========================.
 *
 * âœ… SPARCSwarmCoordinator
 *    - Applies SPARC phases to Features/Tasks
 *    - Coordinates specialized agents per phase
 *    - Tracks progress and quality metrics
 *    - Generates implementation artifacts.
 *
 * âœ… DatabaseSPARCBridge
 *    - Connects database-driven flow to SPARC swarm
 *    - Manages work assignments and results
 *    - Updates database with implementation status
 *    - Provides monitoring and metrics.
 *
 * âœ… Enhanced TaskCoordinator
 *    - Supports SPARC methodology option
 *    - Routes complex tasks to SPARC swarm
 *    - Falls back to direct execution for simple tasks
 *    - Tracks methodology applied.
 *
 * âœ… CLI Commands
 *    - sparc-swarm init: Initialize integration
 *    - sparc-swarm assign-feature: Assign feature to SPARC
 *    - sparc-swarm assign-task: Assign task to SPARC
 *    - sparc-swarm status: Monitor swarm and assignments
 *    - sparc-swarm demo: Demonstrate methodology
 *
 * âœ… Integration Example
 *    - Complete workflow demonstration
 *    - Shows database â†’ SPARC â†’ results flow
 *    - Includes monitoring and metrics.
 *
 * Usage Flow:
 * ===========
 *
 * 1. Initialize Systems:
 *    ```bash
 *    claude-zen sparc-swarm init --swarm-size 10
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. Database-driven product flow creates Features/Tasks:
 *    - Vision documents generate Features
 *    - Features generate Tasks
 *    - Complex items auto-assigned to SPARC swarm
 *
 * 3. SPARC methodology executes:
 *    - Specification: Requirements analysis
 *    - Pseudocode: Algorithm design
 *    - Architecture: System design
 *    - Refinement: Code review & optimization
 *    - Completion: Testing & deployment
 *
 * 4. Monitor progress:
 *    ```bash
 *    claude-zen sparc-swarm status --detailed
 *    ```
 *
 * 5. Results stored in database with full traceability
 *
 * SPARC Methodology Benefits:
 * ==========================
 *
 * ðŸŽ¯ Systematic Implementation
 *    - Structured approach to complex tasks
 *    - Quality gates at each phase
 *    - Comprehensive artifact generation
 *
 * ðŸ¤– Agent Specialization
 *    - Different agents for different phases
 *    - Optimal resource utilization
 *    - Parallel processing where possible
 *
 * ðŸ“Š Quality Assurance
 *    - Validation at each phase
 *    - Quality scoring and feedback
 *    - Iterative improvement
 *
 * ðŸ”— Integration
 *    - Seamless with database-driven flow
 *    - Preserves business requirements
 *    - Adds technical implementation rigor
 *
 * Technical Implementation:
 * ========================
 *
 * The integration successfully demonstrates how SPARC methodology
 * can be applied as the swarm's implementation approach for.
 * Features and Tasks generated by the database-driven product flow.
 *
 * Key technical achievements:
 * - Clean separation: Product Flow = WHAT, SPARC = HOW
 * - Database-first architecture (not document-driven)
 * - Agent coordination with phase specialization
 * - Comprehensive monitoring and metrics
 * - CLI tools for management and demonstration
 *
 * This addresses the user's requirement that "SPARC should be how
 * the swarm works with tasks or features handed to it" within the.
 * database-driven product flow system.
