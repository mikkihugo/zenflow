### For Developers

1. **Testing**: Run stress tests before releases
2. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for resource usage
3. **Documentation**: Document resource requirements
4. **API Design**: Prefer streaming/chunked APIs
5. **Safety**: Use safe Rust patterns, avoid unsafe

## Test Execution Guide

### Running All Stress Tests

```bash
# Run all stress tests (including ignored)
cargo test --release --test '*stress*' -- --ignored --test-threads=1

# Run specific category
cargo test --release --test large_dataset_tests -- --ignored

# Run with memory profiling
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test --release --test memory_stress_tests -- --ignored
```

### Interpreting Results

1. **Memory Reports**: Check for leaks >10MB
2. **Performance**: Compare against baselines
3. **Failures**: Should be graceful, not panics
4. **Resources**: Verify cleanup in all paths

## Continuous Monitoring

### Metrics to Track

1. Memory usage over time
2. Training/prediction latency
3. Error rates by type
4. Resource utilization
5. Concurrent operation count

### Alert Thresholds
