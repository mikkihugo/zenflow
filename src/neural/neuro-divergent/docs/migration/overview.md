## Common Migration Patterns

### Data Pipeline Migration
```python

import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df = df.groupby('unique_id').apply(preprocess)
```

```rust
// Rust: polars-based
use polars::prelude::*;
let df = LazyFrame::scan_csv("data.csv", Default::default())?
    .group_by([col("unique_id")])
    .agg([preprocess_expr()])
    .collect()?;
```

### Model Configuration Migration
```python
# Python: dictionary-based config
model_config = {
    'h': 12,
    'input_size': 24,
    'hidden_size': 128,
    'learning_rate': 0.001
}
model = LSTM(**model_config)
```

```rust
// Rust: builder pattern
let model = LSTM::builder()
    .horizon(12)
    .input_size(24)
    .hidden_size(128)
    .learning_rate(0.001)
    .build()?;
```
