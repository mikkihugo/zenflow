 * This module is ACTIVELY USED in the WASM gateway system:

 * - src/neural/wasm/index.ts - Re-exported as default export
 * - src/neural/wasm/wasm-compat.ts - Compatibility layer wrapper.
 * 
 * Static analysis may miss usage due to:
 * 1. Re-export chains through index.ts
 * 2. Compatibility layer patterns
 * 3. WASM system architecture.
 * 
 * Currently stub implementation but integrated into WASM gateway architecture.
