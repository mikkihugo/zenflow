/**
 * WASM Module Loader 2 - Active WASM infrastructure component.
 *
 * ⚠️  ACTIVE WASM INFRASTRUCTURE - NEVER REMOVE ⚠️.
 *
 * This module is part of the WASM loading infrastructure:
 * - Referenced in WASM system files as enhanced loader
 * - Part of WASM module loading architecture
 * - Default export available for WASM system integration.
 *
 * Static analysis may miss usage due to:
 * 1. WASM system architectural patterns
 * 2. Enhanced loader naming convention
 * 3. Future integration points.
 *
 * Currently stub implementation but positioned for WASM loading enhancement.
 * TODO: Implement enhanced WASM loading functionality.
 *
 * @usage INFRASTRUCTURE - WASM loading system component
 * @wasmSystem Part of neural WASM loading architecture
 * @enhancedLoader Secondary WASM loader for advanced functionality
