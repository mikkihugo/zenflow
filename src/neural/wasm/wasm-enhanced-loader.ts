 * ⚠️  ACTIVE WASM INFRASTRUCTURE - NEVER REMOVE ⚠️.
 *
 * This module provides enhanced WASM loading capabilities:
 * - Advanced WASM module loading and optimization
 * - Neural network acceleration integration
 * - Memory management and performance optimization
 * - Extended functionality beyond basic WASM loading
 *
 * Complements the basic WasmModuleLoader with advanced features:
 * 1. Enhanced loading strategies
 * 2. Performance optimization
 * 3. Neural-specific WASM operations
 *
 * Currently stub implementation but positioned for enhanced functionality.
 * TODO: Implement advanced WASM loading capabilities.
