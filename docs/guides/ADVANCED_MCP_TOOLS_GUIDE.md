# üß† Advanced MCP Tools Guide

This guide explains how to use the 45+ advanced MCP tools implemented in Phase 1 of the claude-zen expansion.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Enable Advanced Tools in Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "claude-zen": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["claude-zen", "mcp", "start"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Discover Available Tools

Use Claude Desktop to run:
```
List all advanced MCP tools
```
This calls `advanced_tools_list` and shows all 45+ tools organized by category.

### 3. Execute Advanced Tools

Use Claude Desktop to run:
```
Initialize a hierarchical swarm with 8 agents
```
This calls `advanced_tool_execute` with the swarm_init tool.
