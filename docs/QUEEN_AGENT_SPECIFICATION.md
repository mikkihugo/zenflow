          spawn_agent(:feedback_analyzer, context)
        ]
    end
  end
end
```

#### **3. Claude Code Integration Coordination**
```elixir
defmodule QueenAgent.ClaudeCodeCoordinator do
  @doc """
  Manages Claude Code execution and monitoring
  """
  def coordinate_implementation(tasks, architecture) do
    # Prepare Claude Code environment
    setup_claude_environment(architecture)
    
    # Execute tasks with monitoring
    results = Enum.map(tasks, fn task ->
      # Start implementation
      execution_id = start_claude_execution(task)
      
      # Monitor progress
      monitor_execution(execution_id, task)
      
      # Validate results
      validate_implementation(execution_id, task)
    end)
    
    # Aggregate and report
    compile_implementation_report(results)
  end
  
  defp start_claude_execution(task) do
    # Convert task to Claude Code commands
    claude_commands = TaskTranslator.to_claude_commands(task)
    
    # Execute with monitoring
    ClaudeCodeRunner.execute_with_monitoring(claude_commands)
  end
end
```

#### **4. Quality Assurance Oversight**
```elixir
defmodule QueenAgent.QualityController do
  @doc """
  Validates all outputs and maintains quality standards
  """
  def validate_workflow_stage(stage, output, context) do
    quality_metrics = %{
      completeness: validate_completeness(output, stage),
      accuracy: validate_accuracy(output, context),
      consistency: validate_consistency(output, context),
      performance: validate_performance(output, stage)
    }
    
    overall_quality = calculate_quality_score(quality_metrics)
    
    if overall_quality >= @quality_threshold do
      {:ok, :quality_approved, quality_metrics}
    else
      {:error, :quality_insufficient, quality_metrics}
    end
  end
end
```
