## Kiro Specs-Driven Methodology

### 3-File Structure Standards

Each feature specification follows the consistent Kiro format:

#### üìã Requirements (`requirements.md`)
- **High-Level Request**: Clear problem statement and objectives
- **User Stories**: EARS notation with personas and acceptance criteria
- **Technical Requirements**: Performance, security, integration constraints
- **Quality Attributes**: Maintainability, usability, extensibility standards
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes and validation criteria

#### üèóÔ∏è Design (`design.md`)  
- **Architecture Overview**: System context and component relationships
- **Component Design**: Detailed technical architecture and patterns
- **API Design**: Interface specifications and integration points
- **Implementation Strategy**: Technical approach and risk mitigation
- **Monitoring & Observability**: Operational considerations

#### ‚úÖ Tasks (`tasks.md`)
- **Task Breakdown**: Specific, actionable implementation tasks
- **Phase Organization**: Logical grouping with dependencies
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear completion criteria for each task
- **Progress Tracking**: Current status and completion evidence
- **Quality Gates**: Validation requirements between phases

### Quality Standards

#### EARS Notation for Requirements
All user stories follow the **Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax**:
```
As a [persona], I want [capability], so that [benefit]
```

#### Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria
- Functional requirements with testable conditions
- Performance benchmarks with measurable targets
- Integration requirements with dependency mapping
- Quality attributes with validation methods

#### Implementation Tracking
- Clear task status indicators (‚úÖ ‚ùå üîÑ üìã)
- Progress evidence with completion verification
- Dependency management with critical path identification
- Risk mitigation with fallback strategies

## Navigation Guide

### üöÄ Quick Start
1. **New Features**: Start with [Core System](./core-system/) to understand foundations
2. **Performance**: Review [Optimization](./optimization/) for enhancement strategies  
3. **Integration**: See [Task Planner Integration](./task-planner-integration/) for best practices
4. **Maintenance**: Check [Hooks System](./hooks-system/) for consolidation examples
5. **Analysis**: Use [Architecture Analysis](./architecture-analysis/) for optimization guidance

### üìö Documentation Patterns
- **Cross-References**: Links maintained across related specifications
- **Version Control**: All changes tracked with clear commit messages
- **Update Consistency**: Changes propagated across all affected documents
- **Review Process**: Peer review required for all specification updates

### üîç Finding Information
