# Design for complete-agent-reuse-system

## Architecture Overview
Advanced system architecture leveraging enhanced agent reuse patterns for optimal performance.

## Component Design
### Agent Pool Management
- **Pool Size**: 2 agents
- **Reuse Rate**: 0.0%
- **Capabilities Covered**: 3

### Core Components
1. **Enhanced Agent Selector**: Intelligent capability-based selection
2. **Agent Pool Manager**: Efficient resource reuse and lifecycle management  
3. **Task Orchestrator**: Optimal task distribution and execution

## Performance Requirements
- Agent reuse rate: >70% after initial pool establishment
- Task selection time: <50ms average
- Pool management overhead: <5% of total resources
