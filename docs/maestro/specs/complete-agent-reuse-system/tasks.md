# Implementation Tasks for complete-agent-reuse-system

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] 1. Set up enhanced agent pool management infrastructure
- [ ] 2. Implement capability-based agent indexing system
- [ ] 3. Create agent lifecycle management with reuse patterns

### Phase 2: Core Implementation  
- [ ] 4. Develop intelligent agent selection algorithms
- [ ] 5. Implement task orchestration with agent reuse
- [ ] 6. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] 7. Integrate with existing orchestrator systems
- [ ] 8. Create comprehensive test suite for agent reuse
- [ ] 9. Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Phase 4: Optimization & Validation
- [ ] 10. Optimize agent pool sizing and cleanup strategies
- [ ] 11. Validate performance improvements and resource usage
- [ ] 12. Conduct end-to-end integration testing

## Dependencies
- Task 2 depends on Task 1 (infrastructure before indexing)
- Task 5 depends on Task 4 (orchestration after selection)
- Tasks 7-9 depend on Tasks 4-6 (integration after core implementation)
- Tasks 10-12 depend on all previous tasks (optimization after implementation)

## Implementation Notes
- Use existing agent management patterns where possible
- Maintain backward compatibility with current orchestrator
- Focus on minimal-change approach for maximum stability
- Implement comprehensive monitoring from the start
