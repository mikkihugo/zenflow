# Core Maestro System Requirements

## High-Level Request

Maestro is a specifications-driven development framework that integrates with Claude-Flow's hive mind infrastructure to enable collective intelligence for software development workflows.

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Specification Management
- **As a developer**, I want to create feature specifications using structured templates, **so that** I can clearly define requirements before implementation
- **As a team lead**, I want to manage specifications across multiple features, **so that** I can coordinate development activities efficiently
- **As a documentation maintainer**, I want living documentation that syncs with code changes, **so that** specs remain current and accurate

### Epic 2: Design Generation
- **As a team lead**, I want to generate technical designs using collective intelligence, **so that** I can leverage multiple perspectives for better architecture decisions
- **As a system architect**, I want AI-powered design recommendations, **so that** I can create comprehensive technical architectures
- **As a developer**, I want design documents that include implementation details, **so that** I can understand the technical approach

### Epic 3: Task Management
- **As a project manager**, I want to decompose features into manageable tasks, **so that** I can track progress and coordinate team efforts
- **As a developer**, I want intelligent task decomposition, **so that** I receive context-aware implementation steps
- **As a team lead**, I want task dependency management, **so that** I can optimize development workflows

### Epic 4: Workflow Orchestration
- **As a developer**, I want consensus validation for critical implementation decisions, **so that** I can ensure quality and alignment
- **As a project manager**, I want workflow phase management, **so that** I can control development progression
- **As a team lead**, I want automated workflow transitions, **so that** I can reduce manual coordination overhead
