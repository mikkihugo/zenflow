# Task Planner Integration Requirements - Simplified Approach

## High-Level Request

Implement a streamlined task planning integration that directly leverages AgentManager task-planner templates with minimal overhead, eliminating the complexity of dual-system coordination while maintaining essential functionality.

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Simplified Integration
- **As a developer**, I want a straightforward task planning service, **so that** I can generate implementation tasks without complex system overhead
- **As a system architect**, I want minimal dependencies and initialization, **so that** I can reduce system complexity and potential failure points
- **As a team lead**, I want fast task generation with reliable fallback, **so that** I can maintain development velocity regardless of agent availability
- **As a maintainer**, I want simple, focused code that's easy to understand and modify, **so that** I can reduce maintenance overhead

### Epic 2: Direct AgentManager Utilization
- **As a developer**, I want direct use of AgentManager task-planner templates, **so that** I can leverage proven agent implementations without wrapper complexity
- **As a system administrator**, I want automatic agent lifecycle management, **so that** I can ensure proper resource cleanup without manual intervention
- **As a performance engineer**, I want efficient agent creation and execution, **so that** I can minimize response times and resource usage
- **As a team lead**, I want consistent task quality from specialized agents, **so that** I can rely on predictable output quality

### Epic 3: Fast Fallback & Reliability  
- **As a developer**, I want immediate fallback to basic task generation, **so that** I can continue working even when agents are unavailable
- **As a project manager**, I want predictable task planning performance, **so that** I can schedule development activities reliably
- **As a team lead**, I want simplified error handling, **so that** I can troubleshoot issues quickly without complex diagnostic procedures

## Implementation Approach

### Simplified Architecture
```typescript
class SimpleTaskPlanner {
  constructor(agentManager: AgentManager, logger: ILogger)
  
  async generateTaskPlan(request: TaskPlannerRequest): Promise<TaskPlannerResponse>
  async getStatus(): Promise<{ available: boolean; method: string }>
  
  private async tryAgentPlanning(request): Promise<string | null>
  private generateBasicTasks(request): string
}
```

### Direct Agent Integration
```typescript
// Direct agent creation and execution
const agentId = await this.agentManager.createAgent('task-planner', config);
await this.agentManager.startAgent(agentId);
const result = await this.agentManager.executeTask(agentId, task);
await this.agentManager.stopAgent(agentId);
```

### Fast Fallback Pattern
```typescript
try {
  return await this.tryAgentPlanning(request);
} catch (error) {
  this.logger.warn(`Agent planning failed: ${error.message}`);
  return this.generateBasicTasks(request);
}
```
