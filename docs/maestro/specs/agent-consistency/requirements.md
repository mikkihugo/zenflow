# Agent Type Consistency Requirements - SOLID/KISS Implementation

## High-Level Request

Standardize agent type handling across MaestroOrchestrator to ensure consistent creation, configuration, and cleanup patterns following SOLID principles and KISS methodology for improved maintainability and extensibility.

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Consistent Agent Lifecycle Management
- **As a developer**, I want all agent types to follow the same creation pattern, **so that** I can easily understand and maintain the codebase
- **As a system architect**, I want standardized agent profiles across all operations, **so that** I can ensure consistent behavior and resource usage
- **As a maintainer**, I want uniform cleanup patterns for all agents, **so that** I can prevent resource leaks and ensure proper lifecycle management
- **As a team lead**, I want SOLID principles applied to agent management, **so that** the system is extensible and testable

### Epic 2: KISS Principle Implementation
- **As a developer**, I want simple, consistent agent configuration, **so that** I can quickly implement new agent types without complex patterns
- **As a system administrator**, I want predictable agent behavior across all operations, **so that** I can monitor and manage resources effectively
- **As a code reviewer**, I want clear separation of concerns in agent management, **so that** I can validate implementations efficiently
- **As a new team member**, I want straightforward agent patterns, **so that** I can contribute effectively with minimal learning curve

### Epic 3: SOLID Principles Compliance
- **As a software architect**, I want Single Responsibility for agent management methods, **so that** each method has a clear, focused purpose
- **As a developer**, I want Open/Closed principle applied to agent types, **so that** I can extend functionality without modifying existing code
- **As a system designer**, I want Dependency Inversion in agent creation, **so that** the system depends on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
- **As a quality engineer**, I want Liskov Substitution for agent interfaces, **so that** all agent types behave consistently

## Implementation Approach

### Centralized Management Pattern
```typescript
// Single method handling all agent lifecycle operations
private async executeTaskWithManagedAgent(
  agentTypes: string[], 
  task: any, 
  capabilities: string[]
): Promise<void>
```

### SOLID Principles Application
```typescript
// Single Responsibility: Agent profile creation
private createStandardAgentProfile(agentType: string, featureName?: string, capabilities?: string[]): AgentProfile

// Open/Closed: Extensible capability mapping
private getDefaultCapabilitiesForAgentType(agentType: string): string[]

// Dependency Inversion: Abstract cleanup implementation
private async cleanupManagedAgents(agentIds: string[]): Promise<void>
```

### KISS Implementation
```typescript
// Simple configuration maps
const capabilityMap: Record<string, string[]> = {
  'design-architect': ['design', 'architecture', 'analysis'],
  'developer': ['implementation', 'coding', 'testing'],
  // ... simple key-value mapping
}

const priorityMap: Record<string, number> = {
  'design-architect': 85,
  'developer': 90,
  // ... straightforward priority assignment
}
```
