# Maestro Internals: Architecture and Implementation

This document provides a deeper dive into the architecture, implementation, and advanced components of the Maestro framework.

## 1. System Architecture

Maestro's architecture is designed to be modular and deeply integrated with Claude-Flow's existing hive-mind infrastructure. It follows a layered approach:

*   **Layer 1: Foundation Services (Existing Claude-Flow Infrastructure):**
    *   **AgentManager:** Manages the lifecycle of all agents.
    *   **CoordinationManager & HiveOrchestrator:** Handle task scheduling, resource management, and multi-agent coordination.
    *   **DistributedMemorySystem:** Provides a high-performance, distributed memory for state management, versioning, and knowledge sharing.
    *   **EventBus:** Enables event-driven communication between components.

*   **Layer 2: Integration Adapters (New):**
    *   **Maestro-Agent Adapter:** Maps Maestro's workflow phases to specific agent capabilities.
    *   **Consensus Adapter:** Bridges Maestro's validation requirements with the hive-mind's consensus engine.
    *   **Memory Adapter:** Extends the distributed memory system for specifications, living documentation, and pattern learning.

*   **Layer 3: Enhanced Services (New & Enhanced):**
    *   **Specs-Driven Orchestration:** The core `MaestroOrchestrator` that manages the end-to-end workflow.
    *   **Living Documentation Sync Engine:** A powerful set of components for real-time, bidirectional synchronization between specs and code.
    *   **Agent Hook Engine:** An event-driven system for triggering background agents and automating tasks.
    *   **Pattern Learning Engine:** A system for learning from past development activities to improve future suggestions.

*   **Layer 4: User Interface (Extended):**
    *   **Maestro CLI:** A set of commands for interacting with the Maestro framework, integrated into the main `claude-flow` CLI.

## 2. Core Components Deep Dive

### MaestroOrchestrator (`src/maestro/maestro-orchestrator-refactored.ts`)

This is the central nervous system of the Maestro framework. It is responsible for:

*   Managing the state of each feature workflow.
*   Orchestrating the phase transitions (e.g., from `Requirements Clarification` to `Research & Design`).
*   Spawning and coordinating the specialized agents required for each phase.
*   Integrating with the hive-mind for advanced features like consensus validation.

### HiveConsensusController (`src/maestro/hive-consensus-controller.ts`)

This component is responsible for the multi-agent validation process. Its key features include:

*   **Multi-Agent Validation:** It deploys a "swarm" of specialized agents to review development artifacts.
*   **Weighted Voting:** Agent votes are weighted based on their expertise and reliability.
*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** The system is resilient to malicious or faulty agents, ensuring that a small number of bad actors cannot compromise the integrity of the validation process.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** It includes mechanisms for automatically mediating disagreements between agents.

### LivingDocumentationSync (`src/maestro/living-documentation-sync.ts`)

This is a sophisticated system that ensures specifications and code do not drift apart. It consists of several sub-components:

*   **ChangeDetectionEngine:** Monitors the file system for changes to both specification and implementation files.
*   **ConflictResolutionEngine:** Intelligently detects and resolves conflicts that arise during bidirectional synchronization.
*   **VersionHistoryManager:** Manages version tracking, snapshots, and rollback capabilities.
*   **SyncOrchestrator:** Coordinates the complex, bidirectional synchronization workflows.

### AgentHookEngine (`src/hooks/agent-hook-engine.ts`)

This engine provides a powerful event-driven automation layer. It allows you to define **hooks** that trigger actions in response to specific events. For example, you can configure a hook to:

*   Run a `quality-assurance` agent every time a `.ts` file is saved.
*   Trigger a `documentation-sync` agent when a `requirements.md` file is modified.
*   Deploy a `security-scan` agent on every `git commit`.

### PatternLearningEngine (`src/maestro/pattern-learning-engine.ts`)

This is a forward-looking component designed to make the Maestro framework more intelligent over time. It is responsible for:

*   Analyzing successful and unsuccessful development workflows to identify patterns.
*   Learning from these patterns to improve the quality of AI-generated content.
*   Providing intelligent suggestions for design and implementation.

## 3. Specification File Structure

Maestro uses a structured, three-file system for each feature, located in `.claude/claude-flow/maestro/specs/[feature-name]/`:

*   `requirements.md`: Contains the high-level request, user stories, and acceptance criteria in a structured format (e.g., EARS notation).
*   `design.md`: The technical design document, including architecture, component design, API specifications, and data models.
*   `tasks.md`: A checklist of the sequential implementation tasks required to build the feature.

This structure ensures that all aspects of a feature are well-documented and version-controlled alongside the code.
