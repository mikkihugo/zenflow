# Architecture Decision for Test validation - this should fail

## Status
accepted

## Context
Architecture decisions for SPARC project: Test validation - this should fail

Domain: general
Complexity: moderate

## Decision
Architecture Decision for Test validation - this should fail:

## Components
- Core System FunctionalityService: service
- Error HandlingService: service
- Data ManagementService: service
- Performance RequirementsService: service
- Core System FunctionalityDataManager: data-manager
- Error HandlingDataManager: data-manager
- Data ManagementDataManager: data-manager
- Performance RequirementsDataManager: data-manager
- APIGateway: gateway
- ConfigurationManager: configuration
- MonitoringService: monitoring

## Patterns
Microservices
- CQRS
- Layered Architecture

## Technology Stack
Technology stack not defined

## Consequences
- Establishes clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Enables modular development and testing
- Provides foundation for scalable implementation
- Leverages proven architectural patterns: Microservices, CQRS, Layered Architecture
