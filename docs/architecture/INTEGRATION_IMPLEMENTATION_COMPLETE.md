### Vision Workflow Implementation

#### Vision Workflow Module
- **Location**: `/business-service/lib/business_service/vision/vision_workflow.ex`
- **Features**:
  - Vision creation with Gemini AI enhancement
  - Quality gate validation
  - Approval workflow
  - Roadmap generation
  - Status tracking
  - Event publishing at each stage

#### REST API Endpoints
- **Location**: `/business-service/lib/business_service_web/controllers/vision_controller.ex`
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/v1/visions` - Create vision
  - `PUT /api/v1/visions/:id/approve` - Approve vision
  - `GET /api/v1/visions/:id/roadmap` - Get roadmap
  - `GET /api/v1/visions/:id/status` - Check status
  - `GET /api/v1/visions` - List visions

#### Quality Gate Processor
- **Location**: `/business-service/lib/business_service/quality/quality_gate_processor.ex`
- **Validates**:
  - Completeness (required fields)
  - Clarity (description quality)
  - Feasibility (constraints and timeline)
  - Business Value (ROI potential)
  - Technical Viability

### Configuration Updates

#### Mix Dependencies
Added to `mix.exs`:
```elixir
{:phoenix_pubsub, "~> 2.1"},
{:finch, "~> 0.18"},
{:fuse, "~> 2.5"}
```

#### Application Supervisor
Updated to include:
- Integration Supervisor
- Service initialization on startup

#### Router Updates
Enhanced with:
- Vision endpoints
- Service status endpoint
- CORS headers for distributed communication
- Security and rate limiting

### Service Communication Flow

1. **Vision Creation**:
   - Client POST to `/api/v1/visions`
   - Vision validated and stored in Mnesia
   - Enhanced with Gemini AI via LLM Router
   - Quality gates validated
   - Event published: `vision:created`

2. **Vision Approval**:
   - Stakeholder approves vision
   - Event published: `vision:approved`
   - Core Service notified to start technical planning

3. **Cross-Service Communication**:
   - All HTTP calls go through Circuit Breaker
   - Failed requests trigger circuit opening
   - Fallback strategies prevent cascade failures
   - All requests include distributed trace headers

4. **Event Flow**:
   - Events published to Phoenix PubSub
   - Subscribers in other services receive events
   - Events persisted to Mnesia for replay
   - Failed events retry automatically

### Monitoring & Observability

1. **Distributed Tracing**:
   - Trace ID propagated across services
   - Span timing for performance analysis
   - Service dependency visualization

2. **Telemetry Events**:
   - Circuit breaker state changes
   - Event bus activity
   - HTTP request metrics
   - Quality gate processing

3. **Health Checks**:
   - `/health` endpoint
   - `/api/v1/status` for detailed status
   - Circuit breaker status per service
   - Event bus statistics

### Testing

#### Integration Tests
- **Location**: `/business-service/test/integration/service_communication_test.exs`
- **Tests**:
  - Event publishing and subscription
  - Circuit breaker functionality
  - Service client HTTP calls
  - Distributed tracing
  - End-to-end flows

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy Other Services**:
   - Implement similar integration in Core Service
   - Add event handlers in Swarm Service
   - Connect Development Service

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Message encryption for sensitive events
   - Event versioning and schema evolution
   - Advanced circuit breaker patterns
   - Service mesh integration

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Event batching
   - Connection pooling tuning
   - Cache implementation
   - Load testing

### Success Metrics

âœ… **Implemented**:
- Full event-driven architecture
- Resilient service communication
- Distributed tracing
- Event persistence and replay
- Quality gate processing
- Vision workflow with AI enhancement

The integration layer is now ready for the Vision-to-Code system, providing a robust foundation for microservice communication with built-in resilience, observability, and event-driven coordination.
