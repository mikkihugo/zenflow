# ag2.ai Integration for claude-code-zen

## Overview

This document outlines the successful integration of [ag2.ai](https://ag2.ai/) (Microsoft's AutoGen) concepts into claude-code-zen's intelligence domain. The integration brings structured multi-agent conversations and enhanced collaboration capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the existing 147+ agent types and domain architecture.

## What is ag2.ai?

ag2.ai (formerly AutoGen) is Microsoft's framework for creating conversational AI systems with multiple agents that can collaborate to solve complex tasks. It enables:

- Multi-agent conversations with defined roles
- Structured dialogue patterns for different scenarios
- Group chat coordination and consensus building
- Teachable agents that learn from interactions
- Conversation memory and context management

## Integration Strategy

### Core Implementation

The ag2.ai integration is implemented in the `src/intelligence/conversation-framework/` directory with these key components:

#### 1. **Conversation Types** (`types.ts`)
Comprehensive type definitions for:
- `ConversationMessage` - Structured messages with types, metadata, and content
- `ConversationSession` - Complete conversation state and management
- `ConversationPattern` - Reusable workflow templates
- `ConversationOrchestrator` - Main interface for conversation management
- `ConversationMemory` - Persistence and retrieval interfaces

#### 2. **Conversation Orchestrator** (`orchestrator.ts`)
Core orchestration engine that manages:
- Conversation lifecycle (create, join, leave, terminate)
- Message routing and validation
- Pattern-based workflow execution
- Consensus building and outcome tracking
- Real-time metrics and analytics

#### 3. **Multi-Backend Memory** (`memory.ts`)
Persistent storage system supporting:
- **SQLite** - Structured conversation data
- **JSON** - Simple file-based storage
- **LanceDB** - Vector search for conversation analysis
- Agent conversation history indexing
- Pattern-based conversation retrieval

#### 4. **MCP Integration** (`mcp-tools.ts`)
Complete MCP tool suite with 8 tools:
- `conversation_create` - Start new conversations
- `conversation_join` - Add agents to existing conversations
- `conversation_send_message` - Send structured messages
- `conversation_get_history` - Retrieve conversation history
- `conversation_terminate` - End conversations with outcomes
- `conversation_search` - Find conversations by criteria
- `conversation_moderate` - Manage conversation behavior
- `conversation_get_patterns` - Discover available patterns

#### 5. **Enhanced Intelligence Tools** (`mcp-integration.ts`)
AI-powered conversation analysis:
- Agent conversation pattern analysis
- Conversation improvement suggestions
- Adaptive pattern creation from successful conversations
- Real-time outcome prediction

## Key Features

### 1. **Multi-Agent Conversations**
```typescript
// Create a code review conversation
const conversation = await orchestrator.createConversation({
  title: 'Review Pull Request #142',
  pattern: 'code-review',
  context: {
    goal: 'Review authentication improvements',
    domain: 'backend',
    constraints: ['security-focused'],
    expertise: ['authentication', 'nodejs']
  },
  initialParticipants: [coderAgent, reviewerAgent, architectAgent]
});
```

### 2. **Structured Message Types**
- `task_request` - Initial work requests
- `task_response` - Work completion responses
- `question` - Information seeking
- `answer` - Information providing
- `suggestion` - Improvement proposals
- `critique` - Code/design feedback
- `agreement`/`disagreement` - Consensus building
- `clarification` - Understanding requests
- `summary` - Progress summaries
- `decision` - Final determinations

### 3. **Conversation Patterns**
Pre-built workflows for common scenarios:
- **code-review** - Multi-agent code review process
- **problem-solving** - Collaborative issue resolution
- **brainstorming** - Creative ideation sessions
- **planning** - Project and task planning
- **debugging** - Collaborative bug hunting
- **architecture-review** - System design evaluation

### 4. **Role-Based Participation**
Agents have specific roles with defined responsibilities:
```typescript
{
  name: 'reviewer',
  agentTypes: ['reviewer', 'architect'],
  responsibilities: ['Review code', 'Provide feedback', 'Approve/reject'],
  permissions: [{ action: 'write', scope: 'group' }]
}
```

### 5. **Conversation Memory and Context**
- Persistent conversation storage across sessions
- Agent participation history tracking
- Pattern-based conversation organization
- Context preservation across message exchanges

### 6. **Outcome Tracking and Analytics**
- Automatic outcome generation from conversations
- Consensus measurement and tracking
- Participation metrics and balance analysis
- Quality scoring and improvement suggestions

## Architecture Compliance

### ✅ Uses Existing 147+ Agent Types
No generic implementations - all patterns use the established `AgentType` union from `src/types/agent-types.ts`.

### ✅ Domain-Driven Design
Conversation framework is contained within the intelligence domain with clear boundaries and interfaces.

### ✅ Hybrid TDD Implementation
- **70% London TDD** - Orchestrator tests mock dependencies and test interactions
- **30% Classical TDD** - Memory tests verify actual storage and retrieval behavior

### ✅ MCP Integration
- HTTP MCP Server on port 3000 for external tool integration
- Stdio MCP support for internal swarm coordination
- Complete tool schema validation and error handling

### ✅ WASM Ready
Framework designed for future WASM integration for conversation analysis and sentiment processing.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Conversation Creation
```typescript
import { ConversationFramework } from 'src/intelligence/conversation-framework';

const system = await ConversationFramework.create({
  memoryBackend: 'sqlite',
  memoryConfig: { database: 'conversations.db' }
});

const conversation = await system.orchestrator.createConversation({
  title: 'Sprint Planning Session',
  pattern: 'planning',
  context: {
    goal: 'Plan upcoming sprint goals and tasks',
    domain: 'project-management',
    constraints: ['2-week sprint', 'team-capacity-limits'],
    expertise: ['planning', 'estimation', 'prioritization']
  },
  initialParticipants: [plannerAgent, developerAgent, testerAgent]
});
```

### Sending Structured Messages
```typescript
await system.orchestrator.sendMessage({
  conversationId: conversation.id,
  fromAgent: plannerAgent,
  content: { 
    text: 'I suggest we prioritize the authentication feature first',
    data: { priority: 1, estimatedHours: 16 }
  },
  messageType: 'suggestion',
  metadata: {
    priority: 'high',
    requiresResponse: true,
    tags: ['planning', 'prioritization', 'authentication']
  }
});
```

### MCP Tool Usage
```bash
# Via MCP client
{
  "name": "conversation_create",
  "arguments": {
    "title": "API Design Review",
    "pattern": "code-review",
    "goal": "Review new API endpoints",
    "domain": "backend",
    "participants": [
      {"id": "api-designer", "type": "architect", "swarmId": "design-team", "instance": 0},
      {"id": "backend-dev", "type": "api-dev", "swarmId": "dev-team", "instance": 0}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### London TDD (Mockist) - 70%
Orchestrator and coordination logic tested by mocking dependencies:
```typescript
describe('ConversationOrchestratorImpl', () => {
  let mockMemory: jest.Mocked<ConversationMemory>;
  let orchestrator: ConversationOrchestratorImpl;
  
  beforeEach(() => {
    mockMemory = { storeConversation: jest.fn() };
    orchestrator = new ConversationOrchestratorImpl(mockMemory);
  });
  
  it('should create conversation and store in memory', async () => {
    const session = await orchestrator.createConversation(config);
    expect(mockMemory.storeConversation).toHaveBeenCalledWith(session);
  });
});
```

### Classical TDD (Detroit) - 30%
Memory and storage behavior tested with actual data:
```typescript
describe('ConversationMemoryImpl', () => {
  it('should store and retrieve conversation exactly', async () => {
    await memory.storeConversation(conversation);
    const retrieved = await memory.getConversation(conversation.id);
    
    expect(retrieved.title).toBe(conversation.title);
    expect(retrieved.messages).toEqual(conversation.messages);
    expect(retrieved.metrics).toEqual(conversation.metrics);
  });
});
```
