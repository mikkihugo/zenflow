```bash
pkill -f vision-test-server.cjs
```

### Test Services
```bash
./test-vision-services.sh      # Basic endpoint tests
./test-event-bus.sh           # Communication and workflow tests
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
curl http://localhost:4106/health | jq .  # Business Service
curl http://localhost:4105/health | jq .  # Core Service
curl http://localhost:4108/health | jq .  # Swarm Service
curl http://localhost:4103/health | jq .  # Development Service
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

The staging environment is now ready for:

1. **Integration Testing** - Full Vision-to-Code workflow testing
2. **Load Testing** - Performance validation under load
3. **API Development** - Implementation of actual Vision-to-Code endpoints
4. **Event Bus Integration** - Real event-driven communication
5. **Queen Agent Integration** - Advanced swarm coordination features

## üìã Architecture Notes

### Service Mapping
The current deployment uses lightweight test servers that implement the Vision-to-Code service interface. The mapping to the original architecture is:

- **Business Service** ‚Üê Maps to business logic and vision management
- **Core Service** ‚Üê Maps to Agent Coordinator service (workflow coordination)
- **Swarm Service** ‚Üê Maps to LLM Router service (swarm and agent coordination)
- **Development Service** ‚Üê Maps to Storage service (implementation and persistence)

### Database Design
The database schema supports the full Vision-to-Code workflow:
- Vision creation and approval workflow
- Roadmap generation and tracking
- Swarm and agent coordination
- Task orchestration and execution
- Event-driven communication logging

### Scalability Considerations
- Each service runs as an independent process
- Database uses SQLite for staging (easily upgradeable to PostgreSQL)
- Event bus architecture ready for Redis/message queue integration
- Service discovery through direct URL configuration (ready for service mesh)
