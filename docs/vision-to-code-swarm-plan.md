# Vision-to-Code Implementation Swarm Plan

## ðŸš€ Swarm Configuration

### Topology: Hierarchical (Queen-led Coordination)
- **Queen Agent**: Overall coordinator and architect
- **Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific implementation experts

     - Define service interfaces and API contracts
     - Coordinate agent activities
     - Ensure architectural consistency
     - Monitor progress and dependencies

2. **Vision Service Agent**

   - Expertise: Image processing, AI/ML integration, feature extraction
   - Tasks:
     - Build vision service API endpoints
     - Integrate with vision models
     - Handle image preprocessing
     - Extract and structure visual features

3. **Language Service Agent**
   - Role: Implement the natural language processing service
   - Expertise: NLP, text analysis, semantic understanding
   - Tasks:
     - Build language service API
     - Process and analyze text descriptions
     - Extract semantic features
     - Generate structured representations

4. **Code Generation Agent**
   - Role: Implement the code generation service
   - Expertise: Code synthesis, template systems, AST manipulation
   - Tasks:
     - Build code generation API
     - Create code templates and patterns
     - Implement generation algorithms
     - Handle multiple output formats

5. **Orchestrator Service Agent**
   - Role: Implement the central orchestration service
   - Expertise: Workflow management, service coordination, state management
   - Tasks:
     - Build orchestrator API
     - Implement workflow engine
     - Manage service communication
     - Handle request routing and state

6. **Testing & Integration Agent**
   - Role: Ensure quality and integration across all services
   - Expertise: Testing strategies, integration patterns, monitoring
   - Tasks:
     - Create comprehensive test suites
     - Build integration tests
     - Set up monitoring and logging
     - Validate end-to-end flows

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Parallel Execution)
All agents work simultaneously on:
- Service scaffolding and directory structure
- Base API framework setup
- Common utilities and shared libraries
- Development environment configuration

### Phase 2: Core Service Implementation (Parallel with Dependencies)
- Vision, Language, and Code Gen agents work on core logic
- Orchestrator agent defines integration contracts
- Testing agent creates test frameworks
- Queen coordinates dependency resolution

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing (Coordinated)
- Service integration implementation
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation generation

### Phase 4: Deployment Preparation
- Containerization setup
- Configuration management
- Deployment scripts
- Monitoring setup

## ðŸ”„ Coordination Strategy

### Memory-Based Coordination
Since MCP tools are not available, we'll use file-based coordination:

1. **Shared Memory Directory**: `.swarm/memory/`
   - Agent status files
   - Decision logs
   - Progress tracking
   - Dependency management

2. **Coordination Files**:
   - `.swarm/memory/swarm-status.json` - Overall swarm state
   - `.swarm/memory/agents/{agent-name}/status.json` - Individual agent state
   - `.swarm/memory/tasks/` - Task assignments and progress
   - `.swarm/memory/decisions/` - Architectural decisions log

3. **Communication Protocol**:
   - Agents update their status after each major step
   - Dependencies tracked in shared memory
   - Progress visualization through status files
   - Conflict resolution through Queen agent

## ðŸŽ¯ Execution Plan

### Immediate Actions (Single Message Batch):

1. **Create Swarm Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .swarm/memory/{agents,tasks,decisions}
   mkdir -p vision-to-code/{vision-service,language-service,code-service,orchestrator}
   mkdir -p vision-to-code/shared/{utils,types,config}
   mkdir -p vision-to-code/tests/{unit,integration,e2e}
   ```

2. **Initialize Swarm Status**:
   - Create swarm configuration file
   - Initialize agent status tracking
   - Set up task queue
   - Create coordination templates

3. **TodoWrite** - Create comprehensive task list:
   - Foundation tasks for each service
   - Integration points definition
   - Testing strategy tasks
   - Documentation requirements

4. **Agent Instructions**:
   - Each agent receives detailed implementation instructions
   - Coordination hooks defined
   - Progress reporting requirements
   - Integration checkpoints

## ðŸš¨ Manual Coordination Protocol

Since MCP tools are unavailable, each agent must:

1. **Before Starting Work**:
   - Check `.swarm/memory/tasks/` for assignments
   - Update agent status to "working"
   - Log decision in decisions directory

2. **During Work**:
   - Update progress in status file after each major step
   - Check for dependency updates from other agents
   - Coordinate through shared memory files

3. **After Completing Work**:
   - Update task status to "completed"
   - Document integration points
   - Signal dependent agents

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

- All 4 services implemented and tested
- Services successfully integrated through orchestrator
- End-to-end vision-to-code pipeline functional
- Comprehensive test coverage (>80%)
- Documentation complete
- Performance benchmarks met

## ðŸ”§ Fallback Strategy

If coordination becomes complex without MCP tools:
1. Implement a simple file-based message queue
2. Use git commits as coordination checkpoints
3. Create shell scripts for agent automation
4. Build simple status dashboard

This plan provides a robust foundation for implementing the Vision-to-Code architecture even without MCP tools, using file-based coordination and careful planning.
