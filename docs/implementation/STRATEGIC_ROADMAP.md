### 🔧 **Technical Implementation Strategy**

#### Architecture Decisions

**1. Neural Network Strategy**
```typescript
// Primary: ruv-FANN for custom models
// Fallback: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs for missing capabilities
// Hybrid: Use both based on task complexity and performance
```

**2. Database Strategy**
```sql
-- SQLite: Core memory, session data, Queen state
-- LanceDB: Vector embeddings, semantic search
-- Kuzu: Code relationships, dependency graphs
-- PostgreSQL: Enterprise deployments only
```

**3. Queen Architecture**
```typescript
interface Queen {
  specialty: string;
  confidence: number;
  workload: number;
  
  process(task: Task): Promise<Result>;
  collaborate(otherQueens: Queen[]): Promise<Consensus>;
  learn(feedback: Feedback): void;
}
```

#### Performance Targets

| Component | Target | Measurement |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Neural Inference | <2s | Average response time |
| Vector Search | <100ms | Query completion |
| Graph Traversal | <50ms | Relationship lookup |
| CLI Startup | <1s | Time to ready |
| Memory Query | <10ms | SQLite operations |
| Queen Consensus | <5s | Decision time |
