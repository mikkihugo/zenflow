## Overview

Claude-Zen is a comprehensive AI-powered development toolkit that bridges human creativity with AI execution through a sophisticated document-driven development workflow and multi-interface architecture.

## Vision Statement

> Transform software development by creating an AI-native toolkit that seamlessly orchestrates document-driven workflows, swarm coordination, and multi-interface interactions to accelerate development from vision to production.

## Background & Context

### Current State
- Software development requires manual coordination between planning, implementation, and deployment
- AI tools are fragmented and require significant integration effort
- Document-driven development lacks automation and intelligence
- Development workflows are linear and don't leverage AI collaboration effectively

### Market Context
- **AI Development Tools**: Growing demand for AI-integrated development environments
- **Document-Driven Development**: Increasing adoption of structured development workflows
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Emerging field of AI agent coordination and swarm intelligence
- **Claude Integration**: Opportunity to leverage Claude's capabilities across development lifecycle

## Strategic Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Unified AI Development Platform**: Create a single toolkit that integrates AI across the entire development lifecycle
2. **Document-Driven Automation**: Enable automatic processing from vision documents to executable code
3. **Multi-Interface Accessibility**: Provide CLI, TUI, Web, and MCP interfaces for different user preferences
4. **Swarm Orchestration**: Leverage AI agent coordination for complex development tasks

### Success Metrics
- **Developer Productivity**: 3x faster from concept to implementation (6 months)
- **AI Integration**: >90% of development tasks supported by AI assistance (12 months)
- **User Adoption**: 1000+ active developers using claude-zen (18 months)
- **Document Workflow**: 80% of projects using vision→code workflow (12 months)

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- **AI-Forward Developers**: Developers who want to leverage AI throughout their workflow
- **Technical Leaders**: Architects and leads managing complex development projects
- **Claude Users**: Developers already using Claude who want deeper integration

### Secondary Users
- **Development Teams**: Teams looking for structured development workflows
- **Consultants**: Technical consultants needing rapid prototyping capabilities
- **Educators**: Teaching modern AI-assisted development practices

## Key Capabilities

### Core Capabilities
1. **Document-Driven Development**: Vision → ADRs → PRDs → Epics → Features → Tasks → Code workflow with AI processing
2. **Multi-Interface Architecture**: Seamless experience across CLI, TUI, Web Dashboard, and MCP integration
3. **Swarm Orchestration**: AI agent coordination for complex, multi-step development tasks
4. **Claude Integration**: Deep integration with Claude via dual MCP architecture (HTTP + Stdio)

### Differentiators
- **End-to-End AI Integration**: From planning documents to deployed code
- **Multiple Interface Options**: Choose the interface that fits your workflow
- **Intelligent Swarm Coordination**: AI agents that work together on complex tasks
- **Production-Ready**: Real-time monitoring, performance metrics, and enterprise features

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Claude API Limits**: Must work within Claude's rate limits and capabilities
- **Node.js Ecosystem**: Built on Node.js/TypeScript for rapid development
- **MCP Protocol**: Must comply with Model Context Protocol specifications
- **Cross-Platform**: Support macOS, Linux, and Windows

### Business Constraints
- **Open Source**: Core functionality must remain open source
- **API Dependencies**: Relies on Claude API availability and pricing
- **Development Resources**: Limited to small team development

### Assumptions
- **AI Adoption**: Developers are ready to adopt AI-integrated workflows
- **Document-Driven Interest**: Teams want structured development approaches
- **Claude Ecosystem**: Claude's ecosystem will continue to grow and improve
- **MCP Standards**: MCP protocol will become widely adopted
