# Version Sync Notes - Alpha.54

## Issue Discovered
- **Local development**: v2.0.0-alpha.53 (`./claude-flow --version`)
- **Published npm**: v2.0.0-alpha.54 (`npx claude-flow@alpha --version`)
- **Git repository**: All branches showed alpha.53

## Root Cause
Alpha.54 was published to npm on 2025-07-14T22:54:53.748Z but the version bump was never committed back to the repository. This created a discrepancy where:

1. The published npm package contained working, tested code as alpha.54
2. Local development was still at alpha.53 with syntax errors we had to fix
3. Users running `npx claude-flow@alpha` got the working alpha.54
4. Developers working locally got the broken alpha.53

## Resolution
Created branch `sync/alpha-54-from-npm` to:
1. Update `package.json` version to `2.0.0-alpha.54`
2. Update binary version using `npm run update-version`
3. Ensure local development matches published npm version

## Verification
After sync:
- ✅ Local: `./claude-flow --version` → `v2.0.0-alpha.54`
- ✅ NPM: `npx claude-flow@alpha --version` → `v2.0.0-alpha.54`
- ✅ Both versions now identical

## Key Learnings
1. **Publishing workflow** needs to commit version bumps back to repository
2. **CI/CD process** should ensure git tags match published versions
3. **Version discrepancies** can cause confusion between local dev and published packages
4. **NPM registry** can be more current than the git repository

## Next Steps
- Consider automating version sync in CI/CD pipeline
- Ensure all future publishes include git commits for version bumps
- Monitor for version discrepancies in future releases
