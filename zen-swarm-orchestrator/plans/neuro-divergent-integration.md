## Discovered Neuro-Divergent Patterns

### 1. Cognitive Diversity Models

#### Multi-Modal Processing Architecture
The lie-detector module implements sophisticated multi-modal fusion strategies that mirror cognitive diversity:

```rust
// Early Fusion: Combines features before processing (intuitive thinking)
pub struct EarlyFusion<T: Float> {
    config: EarlyFusionConfig<T>,
    weights: HashMap<ModalityType, T>,
    feature_dim_map: HashMap<ModalityType, (usize, usize)>,
}

// Late Fusion: Combines decisions after processing (analytical thinking)
pub struct LateFusion<T: Float> {
    config: LateFusionConfig<T>,
    weights: HashMap<ModalityType, T>,
}

// Attention Fusion: Dynamic focus allocation (adaptive thinking)
pub struct AttentionFusion<T: Float> {
    attention_weights: AttentionWeights<T>,
    learned_parameters: AttentionParameters<T>,
    adaptation_history: Vec<AdaptationStep<T>>,
}
```

#### Ensemble Neural Architectures
The neuro-divergent forecasting library demonstrates diverse cognitive approaches:

```rust
// Different models for different cognitive patterns
models: vec![
    ("LSTM_deep", lstm_model),        // Sequential, pattern-based thinking
    ("NBEATS", nbeats_model),         // Decomposition-based analysis
    ("Transformer", transformer),      // Attention-based processing
    ("DeepAR", deepar_model),         // Probabilistic reasoning
    ("NHITS", nhits_model),           // Hierarchical processing
]
```

### 2. Alternative Processing Strategies

#### Adaptive Fusion Mechanisms
- **Early Fusion**: Integrates information at the feature level (holistic processing)
- **Late Fusion**: Combines independent decisions (parallel processing)
- **Hybrid Fusion**: Balances both approaches (flexible thinking)
- **Attention Fusion**: Dynamically weights modalities (context-aware processing)

#### Feature Normalization Strategies
Different normalization approaches represent diverse cognitive preprocessing:
```rust
pub enum FeatureNormalization {
    None,         // Raw processing
    MinMax,       // Bounded thinking
    ZScore,       // Standardized comparison
    L2,           // Magnitude-based scaling
}
```

### 3. Adaptive Learning Mechanisms

#### Dynamic Weight Adaptation
```rust
fn update(&mut self, feedback: &FeedbackData<T>) -> Result<()> {
    // Adaptive weight update using exponential moving average
    for (modality, &performance) in &feedback.modality_performance {
        let alpha = T::from(0.1).unwrap(); // Learning rate
        *weight = (*weight * (T::one() - alpha)) + (performance * alpha);
    }
}
```

#### Attention-Based Learning
The attention mechanism adapts based on:
- Performance feedback
- Cross-modal interactions
- Temporal patterns
- Context relevance

### 4. Non-Linear Thinking Patterns

#### Hierarchical Ensemble Processing
```rust
// Different pattern detection and specialized processing
Pattern {
    name: "trending_weekly",      // Linear trend detection
    name: "seasonal_monthly",     // Cyclical pattern recognition
    name: "declining_mild",       // Negative trend analysis
    name: "multi_seasonal",       // Complex pattern synthesis
}
```

#### Cross-Modal Attention
Enables non-linear connections between different modalities:
```rust
pub struct AttentionParameters<T: Float> {
    query_weights: HashMap<ModalityType, Vec<T>>,
    key_weights: HashMap<ModalityType, Vec<T>>,
    value_weights: HashMap<ModalityType, Vec<T>>,
    cross_modal_matrix: Option<Vec<Vec<T>>>,
}
```

## Integration Patterns

```

## Cognitive Diversity Benefits

### 2. Improved Accuracy Through Diversity

```rust
// Ensemble consistently outperforms individual models
let ensemble_mae = 0.82;
let best_individual_mae = 1.24;
let improvement = 33.9%; // Significant accuracy gain
```

### 3. Adaptive Intelligence

- **Context Sensitivity**: Different strategies for different situations
- **Learning from Disagreement**: Model conflicts highlight edge cases
- **Continuous Evolution**: System adapts processing strategies over time

```

### 4. Emergent Behavior Patterns

  collective_insight:
    trigger: "Multiple agents reach similar conclusions independently"
    action: "Elevate confidence and explore deeper"
    
  creative_breakthrough:
    trigger: "Outlier agent finds novel pattern"
    action: "Allocate resources to explore new direction"
    
  adaptive_reorganization:
    trigger: "Performance plateau detected"
    action: "Restructure agent relationships and strategies"
```

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Resource Management

```yaml
resource_allocation:
  cognitive_diversity_overhead:
    memory: "+20-30% for multiple models"
    compute: "+15-25% for parallel processing"
    coordination: "+10-15% for fusion strategies"
    
  optimization_strategies:
    - selective_activation: "Activate models based on context"
    - shared_representations: "Reuse common features"
    - adaptive_precision: "Adjust model complexity dynamically"
```

### 2. Coordination Complexity

// Manage inter-agent communication
pub struct CognitiveDiversityCoordinator {
    agent_registry: HashMap<AgentId, CognitiveProfile>,
    interaction_graph: Graph<AgentId, InteractionType>,
    conflict_resolver: ConflictResolutionStrategy,
    synthesis_engine: CreativeSynthesizer,
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimization

- **Batch Processing**: Group similar cognitive tasks
- **Caching**: Store and reuse intermediate results
- **Pruning**: Deactivate underperforming strategies
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute work based on agent strengths
