### Memory-Driven Development Pattern
```bash
# Store architectural decisions for cross-agent coordination
./claude-flow memory store "wasm_optimization_strategy" "SIMD-enabled, size-optimized modules with progressive loading"
./claude-flow memory store "build_targets" "core,neural,forecasting,swarm,persistence modules"
./claude-flow memory store "performance_targets" "<2MB total, <100ms load time, >90% size reduction vs JS"

# All agents reference shared memory for consistency
./claude-flow sparc run coder "Implement neural WASM module using Memory('wasm_optimization_strategy') and Memory('performance_targets')"
./claude-flow sparc run tester "Test WASM modules against Memory('performance_targets') specifications"
```

This comprehensive Claude Code integration ensures coordinated, efficient development of the WASM implementation while maintaining full visibility and control over the 5-agent development process.
