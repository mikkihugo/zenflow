# üöÄ Agent Coordination Prompt: WASM Implementation Swarm

## üéØ Mission
Initialize a 5-agent swarm to implement the complete WASM integration for ruv-swarm, exposing all Rust capabilities (ruv-FANN neural networks, neuro-divergent forecasting, and ruv-swarm orchestration) through WebAssembly interfaces in the NPX package.

## üìã Pre-Implementation Checklist
- [x] Planning documents created (00-08 in /plans/wasm/)
- [x] Neural architecture research completed
- [x] Claude Code integration patterns documented
- [x] SWE-bench testing strategy defined
- [ ] Implementation phase ready to begin

## ü§ñ 5-Agent Swarm Initialization Command

```bash
claude "Initialize 5-agent WASM implementation swarm for ruv-swarm. Each agent should follow their respective planning documents in /workspaces/ruv-FANN/ruv-swarm/plans/wasm/. 

Agent 1 (WASM Architect - Convergent): Implement build pipeline from 01-agent1-wasm-architecture.md
Agent 2 (Neural Specialist - Divergent): Implement neural integration from 02-agent2-neural-integration.md  
Agent 3 (Forecasting Specialist - Systems): Implement forecasting models from 03-agent3-forecasting-models.md
Agent 4 (Swarm Coordinator - Critical): Implement orchestration from 04-agent4-swarm-orchestration.md
Agent 5 (Integration Specialist - Lateral): Implement NPX integration from 05-agent5-npx-integration.md

Use TodoWrite for task coordination and Memory for sharing architectural decisions. All agents must ensure:
1. Per-agent neural networks using ruv-FANN and neuro-divergent
2. WASM modules compile and optimize correctly
3. All tests pass (unit, integration, performance, SWE-bench)
4. MCP tools function properly with new WASM capabilities
5. NPX package works seamlessly with progressive loading

Begin parallel implementation following the 4-week timeline in 00-master-wasm-implementation-plan.md" -p --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format stream-json --verbose

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
```bash
# Each agent must ensure their unit tests pass
npm test -- --coverage --testPathPattern="wasm"
cargo test --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
# Test cross-agent functionality
npm run test:integration
./test-mcp-tools.js --wasm-enabled
```

### Performance Tests
```bash
# Verify performance targets
npm run benchmark:wasm
cargo bench --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### SWE-bench Tests
```bash
# Validate coding capabilities
claude "Run SWE-bench test suite on WASM-enabled swarm" --swe-bench-mode --output-format stream-json
```

## üîÑ Coordination Patterns

### Memory-Driven Architecture Sharing
```javascript
// Agent 1 stores build configuration
TodoWrite([{
  id: "wasm_build_config",
  content: "Store WASM build configuration in Memory",
  status: "completed",
  priority: "high"
}]);
Memory.store("wasm_build_config", buildConfig);

// Other agents retrieve and use
const buildConfig = Memory.get("wasm_build_config");
```

### Parallel Task Execution
```javascript
// All agents work simultaneously on their modules
Task("Agent 1: Build Pipeline", "Implement WASM build system from plan");
Task("Agent 2: Neural WASM", "Create neural network bindings");
Task("Agent 3: Forecasting WASM", "Implement forecasting models");
Task("Agent 4: Swarm WASM", "Build orchestration system");
Task("Agent 5: NPX Integration", "Create progressive loading");
```

### Progress Synchronization
```javascript
TodoWrite([
  { id: "week1_milestone", content: "Complete WASM setup", status: "pending" },
  { id: "week2_milestone", content: "Core features implemented", status: "pending" },
  { id: "week3_milestone", content: "Integration complete", status: "pending" },
  { id: "week4_milestone", content: "Testing and optimization", status: "pending" }

## üèÅ Start Implementation

Execute the swarm initialization command above to begin the implementation. Each agent should:
1. Read their respective planning document
2. Use TodoWrite to track their tasks
3. Share critical decisions via Memory
4. Coordinate through the swarm orchestrator
5. Validate their work continuously

The swarm should operate with high autonomy while maintaining coordination through the established patterns. Regular status updates should be provided through the monitoring system.

**May the swarm intelligence guide us to success! üêù**
