## Model Components Explanation

### Trend Stack Analysis

The trend stack captures long-term patterns in task complexity:

1. **Polynomial Trend Block**: Identifies complexity growth patterns
   - Captures learning curves and skill development requirements
   - Detects exponential complexity increases in integration tasks

2. **Exponential Trend Block**: Models rapid complexity changes
   - Handles debugging complexity escalation
   - Manages performance optimization challenges

### Seasonality Stack Analysis

The seasonality stack identifies recurring patterns:

1. **Fourier Seasonality Block**: Detects periodic task patterns
   - API integration cycles
   - Testing and validation phases
   - Code review patterns

2. **Cyclical Patterns Block**: Captures development cycles
   - Refactoring iterations
   - Feature development loops
   - Quality assurance cycles

### Generic Stack Analysis

The generic stack handles novel and irregular patterns:

1. **Adaptive Decomposition Block**: Learns from new task types
   - Novel framework adoption
   - Custom algorithm development
   - Domain-specific requirements

2. **Residual Decomposition Block**: Captures remaining complexity
   - Edge case handling
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Performance edge cases

## Customization and Fine-tuning

### Domain-Specific Training

```python
# Fine-tune for specific domain
trainer = TaskDecomposerTrainer(
    model=decomposer,
    domain="fintech",
    training_data="fintech_tasks.json"
)

# Add domain-specific patterns
trainer.add_patterns([
    "regulatory_compliance",
    "security_audit",
    "risk_assessment",
    "payment_processing"
])

# Train with domain data
trainer.fine_tune(epochs=10, learning_rate=1e-4)
```

### Custom Decomposition Strategies

```python
# Define custom strategy
custom_strategy = {
    "name": "startup_mvp",
    "description": "Rapid MVP development strategy",
    "pattern": "mvp_focused",
    "phases": [
        "core_features_only",
        "basic_testing",
        "quick_deployment"
    ],
    "complexity_multiplier": 0.6,
    "speed_priority": True
}

# Register strategy
decomposer.register_strategy(custom_strategy)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Over-decomposition**: Tasks broken into too many small pieces
   - **Solution**: Increase `complexity_threshold` parameter
   - **Adjustment**: Set minimum task duration limits

2. **Under-decomposition**: Large tasks not properly broken down
   - **Solution**: Lower `complexity_threshold` or increase `max_subtasks`
   - **Adjustment**: Enable aggressive decomposition mode

3. **Incorrect Dependencies**: Wrong task ordering
   - **Solution**: Verify domain-specific training data
   - **Adjustment**: Manual dependency review and correction

4. **Poor Time Estimates**: Unrealistic duration predictions
   - **Solution**: Calibrate with historical project data
   - **Adjustment**: Adjust complexity multipliers per task type

### Performance Optimization

```python
# Optimize for inference speed
decomposer.optimize_for_speed()

# Optimize for accuracy
decomposer.optimize_for_accuracy()

# Batch processing for multiple tasks
results = decomposer.batch_decompose(task_list, batch_size=32)
```
