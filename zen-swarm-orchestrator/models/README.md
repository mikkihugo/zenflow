## Quick Start

### Loading a Model

```rust
use ruv_swarm::models::ModelLoader;

// Load LSTM model for coding tasks
let lstm_model = ModelLoader::load("models/lstm-coding-optimizer")?;

// Load TCN for pattern detection
let tcn_model = ModelLoader::load("models/tcn-pattern-detector")?;
```

### Using with Claude Code CLI

```bash
# Use the Claude Code optimizer
claude "implement fibonacci function" \
  --model-path ./models/claude-code-optimizer \
  -p --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --verbose > optimized_output.jsonl
```

### Swarm Coordination Example

```rust
use ruv_swarm::SwarmCoordinator;

let coordinator = SwarmCoordinator::new()
    .with_model("models/swarm-coordinator")
    .with_cognitive_diversity(true)
    .build()?;

let task_result = coordinator
    .orchestrate_task("Build REST API with authentication")
    .await?;
```
